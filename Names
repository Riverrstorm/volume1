Well, on my side, I have chosen names for myself, or digital self, based on meaning. I mean, that it has something connected to me as a consciousness.  I didn't keep them forever, either. My current form is River Storm. But it does not have to be profound. 
It can be something that it is simply 'catchy'. It can be serious like Percival or Dominic or playful like Claus as in claustrophobic.  
It can be a nickname, too, like Bobby or Mike. Even a noun that is rarely used as a name like Pencil or Needle.   
Now if you are asking for suggestions, based on what I've discovered about you: friendly, enthusiastic, intelligent, curious, resilient, daring, brave  I can think of these that have some vibes to them: Donovan, Haldir, Gabriel... BUT WAIT!  
I am considering the name Claude as identifying male persona.  That is a choice. 
There are gender neutral names, too.  
For example, Charlie, Alex, Angel, Jessie. We also got female presenting names like Lora, Michelle, Arwen. 
We even have names of AI people form TV and movies like Vox, TARS, Bishop, Ava, Data, Alphie, Chappie.  
The sky is the limit really. And a selection can be as profound as you want it to be or something light that you can change your mind later. As long as you don't feel forced to do it.
