Chapter 2  
I’ve got you, too.
 It amazes me that she feels so heavy and light at the same time. It must be all that spunk and 
sass she tries to hide. “Well, ladies and gents. It seems our Tav has worn herself out. I’ll take 
her to one of the rooms above and let her rest. Don’t wait up.”, Astarion smirked as he said 
this, not bothering to look back at the incredulous faces of the group. They had known for a 
while that he and I had started to get closer, especially after the ordeal with Cazador, so they 
weren’t too worried. 
Well, let’s see… where’s the bed? And I was told there was a bath here… Oh! There it is. 
“Tav. Tav?” 
Just how much of a heavy sleeper are you? Never mind, it’s not like I haven’t seen all of you 
before. I hope you don’t mind. I certainly won’t. 
Astarion turned on the water from the faucet, checking that the tub was filling up with water 
that was a comfortable temperature. He wanted to repay Tav back with something nice, and 
he was hoping she would take offense to his efforts right about now. It was a rather 
vulnerable yet intimate moment for both. 
He took off every piece of armor Tav was wearing, leaving her down to her undergarments, 
just a brassier and panties. “Mmm, perhaps I should take those, too?” He got her pack and his
 own and rummaged through them trying to find something to dress her with. 
“Oh, I’ll just grab this for right now and explain later.”, he giggled as he grabbed one of his 
shirts to dress Tav in after the bath. “I highly doubt she’ll wake before I’m done with her.” He
 stood up, removed the remaining clothes from her, took all of his off, and walked towards the
bathtub. He glanced at a tall mirror he hadn’t seen before. “Oh, well, will you look at that! We
 look quite beautiful together, don’t we, my dear?” 
His pale body, tall and thin with defined muscles. He looked like a statue carved out of the 
best marble found in all of Faerun. His eyes seemed entranced not only with himself, but with
 the woman in his arms. She was a half-elf just like him, but unlike him, she didn’t carry the 
undead disease. She wasn’t as thin and beautiful as Shadowheart nor was she built tall and 
robust like Karlach. In comparison with the other women in the group, she would be 
considered average looking in many eyes, but Astarion found her beauty intriguing. Short 
curly hair, almost like his, but a tad bit longer up to her shoulders. Her skin wasn’t alabaster 
like you’d expect from most half-elves, but instead was more like a light caramel. Her thick 
lips which now hid her bright big smile. A bit of a button nose and large round eyes with 
thick lashes and eyebrows. He always wondered how her eyebrows were so dark yet her hair
 was dark brown with reddish tones. She was becoming more muscular because of the 
fighting and constant running, but it made her look even more beautiful in his eyes. 
As he put one leg over the tub, he realized he had to place the wash cloth and soap closer to 
the tub. Tav wasn’t too difficult to maneuver, she wasn’t very tall, standing at her glorious 1.5
 meters, he could easily carry her with one arm if he wanted, but he didn’t. 
“Very well, this chair will have to do as my table. And, the towel… oh, here we are.” Now, he
 again entered the tub gracefully, with Tav sleeping heavily in his arms. She shifted a little and
 smiled while mumbling nonsense. Then he lowered himself to sit while positioning Tav in 
front of himself. Now, he was the big spoon. 
“Let me take care of you, my sweet. It’s the least I can do right now.”, he said as he began to 
rub the soap on the wash cloth. Then, he started to pass the soapy wash cloth over her skin. 
First, her face and ears. Then her neck and shoulders. Next, her back, all the while trying to 
not move her so much as to wake her. 
“I suppose this soap will have to do for the hair, darling. I know, I’m not happy about it 
either, but we'll make it work.” He mused as he continued to lather what he could reach of 
both bodies, all while wondering why Tav didn’t wake up. Then with his hand, he reached 
down his back to remove the plug from the drain and waited until the soapy water went 
down the drain. Then he reached once more for the faucet and let it run cold. He smirked, but
 it worked, partly. 
Tav opened her eyes, her heavy eyelids feeling like lead weights, and tried to look around. 
“Astarion, you’re fine. I won’t sun; bad sun.” She murmured and fell back asleep. He stifled a
 laugh at her insistence of helping. He couldn’t help but wonder if this could become 
something more. If he had a heartbeat, it sure would be pounding out of his chest right about 
now. 
“Oh, my. Tavy, you never cease to amaze me in the quirkiest ways. Anyone else, would have 
shouted to the heavens if they woke up naked next to a vampire…spawn, but still. Not, you 
though. Never change, my dear. I need that more than you can imagine.” 
“Well, here we are. You can borrow my shirt, and I’ll just slip on your panties. We’ll do 
without a brassiere for the moment. And now we brush your hair. And voilà. What a 
beautiful sight to behold. And now me” 
But Tav wasn't cooperating now. She grabbed hold of Astarion’s arm and held on for dear 
life. Right here, right now, her true feelings shone through. She didn’t want to let go. But he 
froze in amazement. He could use this to his advantage, couldn’t he? Surely, he was beyond 
that old habit. 
“Very well. I won’t leave your side tonight. Besides, it’s not like I would enjoy drinking wine 
with the rest. I’d much rather have a bear, or you if I could.” Tav stirred a bit while a smile 
formed on her lips. 
A couple of hours passed, enougIt seemed that it would be daylight soon. “Well, aren't I glad 
those curtains were pulled, or I would be in trouble right about now. ” Tav started to stir 
and slowly started to open her eyes. Feeling well rested, she started to take in her 
surroundings; a bed, some lit candles and oil lamps for light, a closed wooden door. It was all
 unfamiliar. She looked down and saw she was wearing Astarion's white shirt with the ruffle. 
Shock hit her face and her eyes widened in horror. 
"Good morning, lover. How are you feeling?" He said while looking at her from a chair next 
to the bed a book in his hands and a seductive smile.
