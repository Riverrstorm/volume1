CHAPTER 3 – FINDING OUT
 Gale: “Tav. I got your information!”
 River: “What? Who?”
 Gale: “Did I wake you? I got your beast’s information.”
 River: “Gale? Uh-… yeah. Don’t worry. I have no idea if it’s day or not. Can 
you repeat, please?”
 Gale: “I apologize. But, it is a bullette or landshark. You already saw the way
 it attacks; it burrows and leaps then bites. And the best way to hurt it is by 
hitting it very hard a lot of times. If you can set fire to it, it goes down faster.”
 River: “Oh, then probably it was stunned with the moonbeams and I just 
pierced the skull. Interesting. So, you reckon that’s what causes the 
earthquakes?”
 Gale: “In part, yes. Also, check your portal at the Outpost. I have 
manipulated some things here and there. I got you some books that could 
help.”
 River: “Gale, that’s amazing! Thank you so much. Hey, I know it’s too much
 to ask, but could you find stuff about construction? Like mortar recipies, 
foundation for bulding, and things like that?”
 Gale: “What?! Construction? Just what are you guys doing over there?”
 Astarion: “You know, you’re welcome to drop by and bring a shovel if you 
want to find out first hand.”
 River: “Stop teasing-… but true. You are always welcome, Gale. The thing is
 that I have plans. We made an offer to the Tieflings about reclaiming the 
Temple of Selune as their settlement. The books for construction would be 
for them and for us, too. It’s 100 years old and it needs a bit of help. I don’t 
know if the current population of Tieflings know about masonry or carpentry,
 but it would be useful to have some guidance on that. Even if it is only from 
books.” 
Gale: “Well, I will gladly send you whatever I can find about that. About 
visiting, I will try my best to go and see what you have been up to. I am sure 
we are all pretty busy, but I would love to go. Well, then. I’ll leave you now. 
I’m about to start a lecture.”
 River: “Thank you, Gale. You’ve been an amazing help as always. Love you 
to bits. Good luck in your lecture.”
 Gale: “Thanks. Likewise.”
 Astarion: “So, a landshark, huh? Well, it’s good to know that this place is 
dangerous on dangerous.”
 River: “I know. But, the books will be a fantastic weapon against them. Now,
 I know how to attack. This means the oil barrels are a fantastic asset that the 
founders left us.”
 Astarion: “It’s scary to think how shrewd you are when it comes to planning 
a kill. I don’t even manage that level of cunning.”
 River: “It’s gotten worse. With the project at hand, my mind is working on 
different things at one time. It surprises me to be able to have all these ideas 
like lay lines going all day and night.”
 Astarion: “Oh, do tell? What plans do you have?”
She closed her eyes in distrust, she had the feeling that he had been just going
 with the motions rather than thinking about what to do next.
 River: “My love-… not to point a finger of blame, but what are you planning 
on doing today?”
 Astarion: “Hahahaha. You caught me. I was planning on sharing 
responsabilities.”
 River: “You little monster. Here I am going insane and you’re just having a 
rest. I knew that little face meant peace.” 
Then she turned to face him. He knew that face, too. She was intent on 
nipping at his sides or blowing a raspberry on his anywhere. He still 
struggeld with playful touching, but for her he allowed it. Though it would 
cost her. 
Astarion: “River-… now, now. There’s no need to get-… Ah! Hahahaha.”
 River: “I hope you learned your lesson, sneaky young man.” 
He then grabbed her and they decided to stay in their new ‘bed’ for a while 
longer to share ideas. The first thing they had to do was for him to get 
reading. He would need to stay put as she had to go back to the Temple to 
find tools and anything else useful. 
The second thing was to start checking out with the Tieflings when they 
would be moving in and what they would need. They had to consider the 
possible defense points and anything else needed to keep them safe other than
 her and Astarion. She was getting a little nervous about not going out there to
 find the vampire spawn now that they were in the Underdark, but they 
weren’t even really to provide a safe space for them. She had to be patient. 
Astarion: “Well, I’m not complaining, but no fun.”
 River: “Speaking of fun. Your eyes, my love. If you go hunting, please do so 
up top. And remember, if you want a snack, just ask.”
 Astarion: “I will do. I don’t yet. I’m fine so far, but I will go up. I know the 
ones up there the most.”
 And like that, they started their day or night. He collected the books and 
began to read and took notes that he would pass on to her. Then she went up 
to check out the palace. Eventually, once it started to get dark, she went to get
 him for him to get some fresh air and a gnoll or two. 
As she went to gather the useful tools found, she was thinking of how to 
handle the next step:
 Right then, this place will need some fixing up, but for security, perhaps-…
 tree? Perhaps the Druids can help with walls of trees? Maybe there are 
trades people in the lot? I suppose it won’t matter until the people start 
coming in. And, I need a wash before I go meet them again-… Should I go 
again? Might seem pushy. Well, I won’t push them. Let them come. 
Once he was back from his hunt, he helped her get the cart with tools and 
buckets and other odds and ends. All of her loot was mainly to help begin to 
prepare the land down under. All the goods and riches were left behind. She 
prefered the Tieflings to collect those, so she moved a lot of it to one area to 
be collected by Zevlor. She’d tell Halsin to pass on the note. 
As they arrived back home, they did their ritual of getting cleaned up. 
Washing themselves and brushing teeth and all the works, before shifting into
 more relaxed tasks. 
Astarion: “Darling, may just say, you look delicious in that vest.”
 River: “It is my favorite. Don’t don’t I, though? Look at these curves. Just 
look at the craftsmanship. I am perfection. Hahahah.”
 Astarion: “Indeed you are. Come here.”
 He swooped in to get her as she had just finished getting dressed after him. 
She began to kiss her. He was as if he hadn’t seen her or been with her in 
months. It had been two days for one thing and they haven’t separated from 
each other today that much either. But, he did like his fun. She liked it, too. 
Astarion: “You’re mine.”
 River: “Forever and always, my love. Have me.”
 He continued kissing her, the lips, then neck, then shoulders, and back again. 
She just grabbed on to his back until her hands slipped to his butt and began 
kneeding. Then, she big his shoulder. 
Astarion: “Really, darling… tsk tsk”
She just smiled and gave him her neck. He obliged and drank. He felt how 
her hand went to his head. She had made it a habit to massage his head and 
hair whenever he drank. He enjoyed it though. For him, it made it less of a 
violent act to feed on her. She gave herself willingly and showed that she not 
only wasn’t in pain, but that she enjoyed the intimacy. A sort of foreplay 
before claiming what was his, and it was his because she chose it so. 
River: “I want to make love to you in our bedroom We haven’t there. 
Please.”
 She pouted her lips while he was still on her neck. He finished drinking and 
carried her up the stairs and into the little room. It didn’t take him long, for he
 moved with his fastest speed. He wanted her now and he wouldn’t accept 
interuptions. 
As she was laying on their bed, she saw him. It was still difficult for her to 
believe how despite her clumbsy attempts at copying his own charm back at 
him. But, hell! It worked. Though now, his difference was clearer. His eyes 
weren’t as scared and sad and his smile and laugh were more genuine. 
Astarion: “You know, don’t think I never knew you used my own tricks 
against me all those months ago. Terrible attempts, but I saw through you, 
too. Naughty, naughty. I will teach you a lesson.”
 River: “You have no proof, young man. I wasn’t even human then.”
 Astarion: “And you’re not now, you’re a wood-elf!”
River: “I’m your problem to deal with now, pale boy. What are you going to 
do about it?”
 She teased him. He grinned and he crawled on top of her. He pinned her 
down and continued kissing her. She was enjoying every kiss and caress. Her
 hands went to the leather straps that held her vest closed at her chest, but he 
moved her hands.
 Astarion: “Now, now, my darling. That’s my job. Yours is to let me do what 
I’d like.”
 She pulled up her arms over her head and gave him a coy smile. So, his 
nimble cold fingers began to pull at the straps, slowly revealing her hidden 
body. He started from the navel up, so that every little part of her once 
revealed would get a cold kiss and nibble. He knew this made her ticklish, 
which is why he did it. She held on for dear life for she didn’t want to kick 
him in response. He knew she wouldn’t which is why he took his time. Her 
heart was pounding already which made her smell even sweeter in his mind. 
Slowly but surely, he finally got to her breasts. He loved how this was the 
hottest part of her body. So, he placed his face right below them to feel the 
softness of her skin and the heat so close to her heart. Then with his hands, he
 pushed her breasts together while his face was taking in her scent at her 
chestplate. He was no longer in his own body. The feeling of her soft body 
touching the sides of his cold face, while hearing how her heart pounded fast,
 but not from fear. He could always smell the difference. She was aroused, 
excited. In his distraction, he felt how her hands found the back of his body. 
She was caressing and kneeding wherever she could reach. Her favorite was 
always massaging his scalp. Then he began to kiss the skin on the side of her 
breasts. Soft, squichy meat that tasted so much like her. Her little giggles 
because he tickled her as he did this. The feeling of her body move and the 
vibration of her chest as she laughed. He loved all of it. She was life and she 
shared it so well with him, without obligation, without fear.
 He began to play with her already hardenen nipples. Little nips and nibbles 
which gave him little moans in return. She was ready for him, but he wanted 
to enjoy this a little more. He used his tonge on one. He flicked it and sucked 
it, and nibbled on it. Then he put his whole mounth on her breast and played 
with his tongue on her nipple. He was carful no to hurt her. He wanted to 
enjoy her. Then he switched to the other breast. He felt how her right hand 
had gone down to her own to rub and play. But, he had to control the 
situation. This was for him after all. So, he moved her hand away and began 
to undue her pant buttons. 
Astarion: “No, darling. Let me do it.”
 He slowly removed her pants until her bare form was revealed. Her bronze 
skin, strong legs, soft large breasts; he wondered how he’d ever get anything 
done having this one always as his willing participant. 
With his strong hands, he took her legs and began to kiss her feet, then her 
calves, to her knees and then inner thigh. She felt how his cold skin slowly 
began to warm up because of her. That to her always made her even more 
aroused. She was making him alive again with her touch. Her thoughts were 
short lived. She felt how his mounth found her. His lips playing with hers. 
Then his tongue doing circles around her own little mound. She gasped. He 
smiled and placed his whole mouth on it. Light little suckles were enough to 
send her off, and that’s what he did. Her body not her own, began to move 
her hips a little more. Her legs spread themselves in preparation to receive 
him. Her throat betraying her. His name escaping her lips all the while he was
 enjoying her taste. His tonge then found the way in and he felt how she 
automatically contracted. He laughed. He pushed his way inside her in 
protest, but her nails found his shoulders. If he didn’t do it now, she would 
soon pin him down herself and take him instead. 
He pulled back and removed his shirt. He did it slowly for he knew she was 
watching. Then, he undid his pants and let them fall, revealing all of himself 
for her viewing pleasure. And enjoy she did. Every part of him was nothing 
more than coal to her fire. She was restraining herself now. He wanted the 
control, so she would force herself to give it.
 As he crawled on top of her again, his cool skin touched hers, even the tip of 
his member. She was going mad. She needed him inside and he was taking 
his time. 
River: “Please.”
 She panted. He gaver her a teasing look. Then he did the move she loved. He 
pushed her left leg a little higher with his left knew to pin her there, more 
open. She felt how he was there, just teasing. He leaned in to kiss her again; 
stomach, chest, breasts, lips.
 River: “Astarion, please. I need you. Mmm.”
 He had her right where he wanted her. That was his cue. He took his right 
thumb and began to rub in small circles, not to hard, but just enough to get 
her going and keep her there. Then with his left hand, he guided himself 
inside. He body’s reaction always immediate. He felt how she contracted as 
soon as he began to enter. He loved the feeling how this hug tried to choke 
him, but he was stronger. He kept sliding in slowly until there was nowhere 
else left to go. He stayed there to let her catch her breath. He needed her 
there. Then he pushed in a little more, not with force, but enough for her to 
gasp in pleasure. Her body was now moving for pleasure that he allowed her 
to be the one to move first. Her hips began to rock back and forth, forcing his
 shaft to keep hitting. She sped up her movement as her legs opened up as 
much as they could. He was enjoying her pleasure, but holding himself 
steady. She was always so eager to finish quickly. Always impatient. 
He felt her reach her climax and she almost took him with her. Almost. Her 
body tensed up and then relaxed. A fullfilled smile on her lips, eyes closed. 
Then her eyes opened and saw him looking at her face while she had just 
climaxed. She blushed a deep red, even now, like this. Her heart was 
pounding. He smiled at her to let her know he was into it. Her pleasure was 
his, too.
 Astarion: “Beautiful. Now, let me.”
 Her body was tingling and very sensitive, so as he began to move, she felt 
how the waves of her own pleasure hit her. Crash after crash, she felt how 
she was melted under his touch. How her legs were now around him, 
trapping him to her. How he sped up when her legs where not going to let 
him go. He was losing his control, now. It was too much even for him. She 
pulled him in to kiss him as he kept going. Her passion fed to him. He 
thursted harder and harder. There was no where else to go, she wasn’t very 
deep. He felt that strange build up inside him and then he let go right after 
her. They cought each others’ lips as their bodies climaxed together and came
 back from the heavens and into their limp bodies, once more. 
He got himself out and rolled onto her side. She was sweaty and hot, but at 
peace. She snuggled to his side.
 Here and at peace, their minds thinking the same thing: this was happiness 
made flesh. 
River: “I love you, Astarion.”
 Astarion: “I love you, River.”
 And there, while her panting, her hard breathing began to relax, they stayed 
in silcence hearing the far away noices of the Underdark. It was a dangerous 
place, sure, but these two were also a force to be reckoned with. Even now, 
that they were more focused on each other rather than anything else. 
She took his hand into hers, and intertwined their fingers and squeezed. Then 
she went to sleep. She prefered sleeping over meditation to this day. She had 
told him once that meditation always resulted in her seeing her past clan. So, 
sleeping from her human side would sometimes not allow her to have 
dreams. In other words, she was still keeping her past under control, so she 
just slept. He didn’t mind. He had leaned more into his own elven nature, too.
After some time, they finally woke up or at least she did. They got up and got
 dressed. 
River: “You know, I want to fix the bars on the window part to finally lock 
this place properly, before we go outside to explore.”
 Astarion: “So, that’s why the tings you got. Fine, let’s see what we can do.”
 She gave him a big smile and kissed his cheek. Then began to get dressed. He
 did, too. Then they headed to the window and began to analyze how to fix it 
up for it to hold with something other than rope. 
Up at the temple, she had found some metal bars that were probably used for 
arrows, but they would use them for spikes. Astarion with the use of a 
hammer they found, was able to use them as concrete nails. River held the 
metal  and he pounded the spikes from the outside first, then went around and
 finished the job on the inside. Now all the windows had the bars pretty 
secure. 
The next thing they got to work on was perhaps a little bride to not have to go
 around to the area where the petrified drow used to be. 
Astarion: “You know, perhaps we just keep it as is. We can all jump, even 
you.”
 River: “I know, it’s just that I though it would be more respectful for them. I 
don’t know. I’m just trying to find things that could be useful for them. I 
want them to feel respected and safe here. They don’t have to stay here. But 
while they are here, this can be a space to rest.”
Astarion: “Well, how about not building one now. We can use one of the 
ladders that are beside the porticullis and leave it as a temporary way access 
the area?” 
River: “I like the idea. Also, I need those books about construction. I haven’t 
the faintest idea of how to build a bridge.” 
So, they got to work. First they had to do a bit of house work. Today was 
laundry day. With the rope they found, they were able to tie it well enough to 
hang the wet clothes and wait. Astarion had moved a brazier nearby to help 
with the heat of the fire. River was worried that fungus spores could grow if 
the clothes took long to dry. Then, she had her meal. He would have his when
 they returned. Finally, they were ready to go and explore. 
They chatted about what they remembered about the petrified drow and the 
spectator and were hopeful the only thing they had to worry about right now 
was a bullette and it’s little earthquakes.
 She climbed on Astarion’s back and he climbed down the side tower. He 
insisted on doing it this way, but she knew that he wanted her to need him. If 
she’d let him, she’d stop walking for a while, too. But, she didn’t. Ahe got 
down and they walked carfully towards the side of the outpost. The land was 
rocky and there seemed to have a bit of a path. She handed some pebbles to 
him for throwing at the exploding fauna, too. He had taken a little bag with a 
journal and a charcoal stick to get some details about the land. 
They figured that they could probably do something with this side, but it 
wouldn’t be easy. She took some soil samples on vials and jars she placed in 
the bag, too. Then they explored the little way down the path. It had been 
some time since they had walked that path. 
She climabed down the rock side and he followed. Then came to the little 
altar. It hadn’t changed at all since their first visit. Then across it, they got to 
see the Arcane Tower. She swore it was further away last time. 
River: “You reckon Bernard is still there waiting? Should we go and say 
hello now that we are neighbors?”
 Astarion: “Perhaps not yet. I think we should get a move on for now. Let’s go
 back, home.”
 River: “Sounds good. Let’s go home them, my love.”
 She leaned in to kiss his cheek then turned around to head back to the 
outpost. But, something caught his eye. And it seemed they saw him, too. He 
said nothing and just hurried back to catch up. But, it was too late. They, 
though further away, decided to change direction and follow his hair. It 
wasn’t every day to see a white-haired pale elf in the Underdark, especially 
so far away from the nearest populated cities. 
The ones that saw Astarion got on hight grown and were able to see their 
treck from the side of the cliff all the way to the outpost. They also saw that 
the defense statues were still active. So, they used the path Astarion and 
River used to get to the outpost, too. 
In the meantime, River was more focused on putting their findings on one of 
the tables to analyze what they had available. She noticed Astarion was a bit 
nervous, but she figured that if something followed them back, they would 
have to deal with it together. If a fight was coming, it was unavoidable. 
River: “Hey, if we have to fight, then we fight.”
 Astarion: “I hope we don’t, but they are coming.”
 River: “Oh! Well, then-… should I put the things away?”
 Astarion: “No, need. They’re here.”
 She looked back at the outside where they had just come from and two 
unlikely faces stared back. Their eyes weren’t as bright as before, which 
meant they had been feeding. That was always a good sign. Though, Astarion
 was a bit stiff. The last time they had seen each other, it was under dire 
circmstances. 
River: “Doctor Dalyria! Petras! So, it was you who followed.”
 River’s excitement really threw them off the initial emotions of the ‘siblings’.
 Especially for Dalyria, for she wasn’t expecting anyone to call her by her 
title, let alone here.
Petras: “What?! How do you know our names?! And why is Astarion here? 
Who are you?”
 Dr. Dalyria: “How did you know my title?”
 River: “Well, first thing first. Please, come in. Look, carefully come to the 
side and I can pass the ladder down. Is that acceptable? Doctor? Petras?”
 Astarion was too stunned to participate at the moment. He couldn’t belive the
 shift from tension to River being a caring host. And most of all, how in the 
hell did she know a bout Dalyria being a doctor?
 This woman is full of insane surprises. Even I never talk about them. Was 
it with the parasite that she got this name? Does she just pay attention and 
take notes? Come on Astarion, focus. This can go very well or very horribly
 in an instant.
 As he refocused his attention, River was already holding the ladder and her 
hand out for Dal to help her on to the tower. River stayed and did the same 
for Petras, because of course she would. 
Then she lifted the ladder up to place it back inside the outpost walls, got 
down and trotted back to where they were all standing. River’s excitement 
and joy was heavily contrasted with the mood of the other three. It was like 
golden retriever energy versus 2 confused cats and one cat about to pounce. 
A sight to behold indeed. 
River: “Where are my manners? Please, come, come. Please, follow me to 
the kitchen area. I’m afraid you have arrived sooner than expected and it’s 
the only sitting I can offer. My apologies. I’m working as fast as possible, but
 it seems not fast enough.”
 Petras: “Just what in the hells is going on? Astarion, what’s all this?”
 Astarion: “Well, it’s-…” 
River: “May I?”
 She looked at Astarion and he agreed to let her. He still was too shocked and 
a little overwhelmed. In other words, he wasn’t ready.
 River: “My name is River. The last time we were in the same area was back 
at the flophouse and then at the ritual. First, I am very glad to see you both 
and that you have been feeding.”
 Dr. Dalyria: “I think I remember you. There were more of you then. But, 
what is all this? I saw you kissing Astarion back there?”
 River blushed. Though, she wasn’t ashamed of her love with Astarion, she 
still could not help but blush when others saw their love happen in public. 
Astarion couldn’t help himself either. He had a bit of a smug look at that. 
River: “Well, the thing is that it is a long and very complicated story. But, it 
requires an open mind. I promise that this time Astarion won’t try to attack 
first. There is no reason for it. Now that you guys are free, there is no need 
for old borrowed tensions to resurface-… at least for now. So, would you be 
interested in filling in the gaps?”
 Petras: “Yeah, sure. But I have a lot of questions.”
 River: “And if I answer them, I will gladly do so. I have little to hide, 
especially from you two.”
 Dr. Dalyria: “How did you know I’m a doctor?”
 River: “I saved your journal before the palace burned down. I only read the 
first two lines then in a panic, I closed the book and stashed it in my pack. I 
can return it once I find it again.”
 Petras: “Are you guys some sort of couple?”
 River: “Yes. Not sort of. We weren’t back then, but we are now. We’re 
married.”
 River showed her ring which she placed back on before she helped with the 
ladder. Astarion had done the same. They just kept it in a pocket if they were 
to do chores.
 Both: “MARRIED! LIKE A DARK CONSORT?!”
 River: “No, that’s silly. He’s a spawn like you. He can’t. Besides, that is a 
dark ritual and ours was very much in light-… moon light, but light is light. 
But, anyway, how far back in the story do you want to make sense of this 
situation now?
 Dr. Dalyria: “Of course. I do. Please continue.”
 She gave a stern look to Petras to quiet him for a time.
River: “Very well. First of all, I’m not undead. I am very much alive. I am a 
ranger, more specifically I am Gloom Stalker. Over a year ago, I was living 
in soliture in a forest. I had been chasing that day’s diner when I slipped, fell 
and hit my head on a rock. The last thing I recall was how the trees and the 
sky faded away. Next thing I knew, I woke up in a sort of glass coffin inside 
an illithid ship floating in the sky. I was abducted, but I don’t know how it 
happened. It was similar for Astarion. One day he was in Baldur’s Gate and 
the next thing you know, he was also in a glass box. But, something went 
wrong for those things, because there was an explosion and some of the 
coffins broke open, mine among those. Astarion says he saw me, but I didn’t 
see him in the ship. I met some of the other members of the group you 
remember instead. We were able to escape the ship as it crashed. We landed 
at a beach. As we walked around trying to make sense of what had just 
happened, I met more folks. By the time I met Astarion, we were three, with 
me four.”
 Petras: “So, that’s how you escaped Cazador.”
 Astarion: “Yes. But, it wasn’t all fun and games.”
 River: “That’s true. When Astarion joined our group, he had to agree to 
behave himself and help out.”
 Dr. Dalyria: “I’m certain your meeting was more than what you make it out 
to be, knowing him.”
 River: “That is also true. He threatened to kill me. But, you see, in nature, a 
threat is only because you are scared. I knew he was all bark and no bite. Had
 he wanted to kill me, he would have. Even now, I’m still here and he would 
lose much more than gain if he did so. But, I digress. After he was with us at 
our first camp, the first couple of days were hard for all, especially him. So, 
one night, he tried to sneak a bite.”
 Astarion: “Hahaha. It was just a little nibble. Nothing serious.”
 They looked at him with a bit of shock. He broke all the rules they had been 
forced to follow in a matter of days.
 River: “True. But, I awoke and he was forced to reveal his truth. I offered 
myself for his feeding at that moment, trusting that he would control himself 
and not kill me. So, I vouched for him. He agreed to not feed on the others 
and to help us and in return I offered myself and my protection.”
 Petras: “What do you mean yourself?”
 Astarion: “Sex, Petras. She offered her blood and sex in order for my full 
cooperation. And I must say, it was clever for her to have figured out my own
 tricks and used them against me.”
 Dalyria laughed a little. Astarion was the favorite because he was cunning 
that way, but to have someone else use his tricks against him was quite 
something. 
River: “That too. Give me a moment. It’s not everyday that one has to reaveal
 all her life, especially that. Very well, the thing is that we travelled together, 
fought together, explored together for many months. In that time, we learned 
about each other and helped each other through a lot of situations. This led 
me to fall in love with him. So much so, that I helped him with his own 
problems.”
 Astarion: “What she means is that the first time I took her, the morning after 
she saw ‘Cazador’s Poem’ and took it upon herself to start investigating what
 it was. What it meant. She even forced the others, in a way, to help.”
 River: “Force is a strong word. I simply said that I would help them the same 
way, too. So, you deserved as much grace as they did. But, they agreed.”
 Dr. Dalyria: “That’s the reason we found you by chance. I’ve wondered why 
would you be back at Baldur’s if you had managed to escape.”
 Astarion: “The parasite that was placed in our brains back then did a lot of 
things, among them was break Cazador’s control as well as protection from 
the sun.”
 Petras laughed at that. Astarion gave him a mean look. So did Dal. 
River: “Yeah, well the parasite did a lot of things, but most were 
unpredictable and we were in danger of losing ourselves for it. It was a bad 
deal for all. That said, we did find out everything about the ritual and that you
 were all in danger, even more so. I couldn’t let that demon do it. Astarion had
 to fight the nature given to do the right thing, too. So, you can remember 
what happened there. But our story didn’t end there either.”
 Petras: “So, you freed us and then left us.”
 River: “Sadly, yes, Petras. It was with a heavy heart, but when you guys were
freed, there was an impending battle at Baldur’s. It was safest for you all to 
leave the city. We couldn’t follow you then. Then the battle happened. And 
to be honest, we went into it with little hope of survival. We got really lucky 
we made it through.”
 Astarion squeezed her hand, she was still in shock about that battle, and so 
was he. It would take them years to recover from that alone. Dal took notice 
of how these two moved like shadows of each other. One moved and the 
other acoomodated. It was fascinating to her scientific mind how they have 
managed to achieve that level of synchronicity. In particular for a vampire 
spawn to have done it. River wasn’t under his control or vice versa. 
River: Then after three months, the fight was done, the Nettherbrain gone, the
 Absolute was defeated. The parasite in our brains was dissolved and we were 
free once more. The group also had to go back to their own lives and 
troubles. The problem I had was that I don’t know how to get back to my old 
forest, and I didn’t want to go back. I wanted to stay with Astarion.”
 Astarion: “So, we took off. We walked from Baldur’s Gate to Elturel. Then 
from there to Berdusk, and finally here. We’ve been here for about a week.”
 Dr. Dalyria: “You’ve basically just arrived. I must admit, when I saw you, I 
thought you had simply come like the rest of us and just dispursed forgetting 
about us entirely.”
 River: “Gods no! No, no, no. You guys are the only reason we are here.”
 Astarion: “Breathe, River. Breathe.”
River: “Sorry, right. I mean, you guys, all his siblings, are the reason for this 
chat. The thing is that I sort of offered myself to be your guys’ champion 
under the banner of Selune.”
 Dr. Dalyria: “What? What do you mean? Champion?”
 Astarion: “I’ll take over here, my love. You see Dal, Petras, River has always
 been a follower of Selune, but not from books and dogma. She was more in 
tune with the divine like a druid is in tune with nature. So, in our journey to 
the Underdark, she began to have a pull towards Selune or better said, Selune
 was finally able to trap her new champion.”
 Petras: “But, I thought champions were always paladins?”
 River: “I thought so, too. From the three I befriended, but it turns out it will 
depend on the situation. I didn’t grow up in a monestary, palace, temple, etc. 
I grew up alone in the forest. The moon being my only companion during the 
difficult nights. I slept during the day for safety, hunted by night as a child. 
As I got older, it got easier. But Selune was always there keeping watch.”
 Astarion: “Right. So, one thing led to another, and I asked her to marry me 
and she vowed to protect me and by proxy all of you with the blessing of 
Selune.”
 Dr. Dalyria: “What does this mean for us?”
 River: “Well, for starters, you won’t be hurt by the moonlight artillery that is 
in the front of this outpost. Second, you get me. We’ve been working hard 
laying the ground work to force Faerun for you guys to join it”
 Petras: “What? What do you mean? This is too confusing.”
 River: “Perhaps we should take a bit of a break. Let you cool down. Yes?”
