Chapter 1 – Home
 Welcome back. Where were we? Ah! Yes. I will assume you know about the 
previous journey to the Underdark. If not, get out of here! But, if you still 
remember their journey, then have a seat. I’ve got food and drink. Help 
yourself. So, let’s continue.
 Tav was left cleaning up the now kitchen area and the simple reason was that 
it was the room with a fire for cooking. She placed her bed roll near the fire 
to keep warm and Astarion put his next to hers. 
By now, not a lot of time has passed to be honest. At most a couple of hours. 
There isn’t much to tell the time yet, so they gage it by how sleepy Tav-… 
sorry, River gets. (It’s going to be a bit of a challenge and I knew!)
 Anyway, let’s look back through my looking glass and see what they are up 
to now. Come along. Look.
 Astarion: “So, what else? I’m a little sore.”
 River: “Really? Can you really get sore? Not that I don’t believe you, it’s just
 that I thought you didn’t. But if you want to rest, that’s not a problem.”
 Astarion: “On second thought, what else is there to do?”
 River: “Planning? The thing is that I needed this space cleaned up a bit, so I 
can think better. There are lots of things to do, which include the chests you 
want to open.”
 His ears perked up to that. He’d forgotten all about them. There were at least 
3 locked chests, a lot of oil barrels, and other supplies. River thought that a 
lot of it was still good and was planning to rebuild. 
Astarion: “Very well. What ideas do you have?”
 River: “If your’re going to make your faces, I’ll just do it myself. But, you 
know what? No, you will help even if you roll them eyes! Astarion! Hahaha, 
Stop. I’ll bite you, I will. Hahahaha”
 He got caught making faces so he got behind her and pulled her into a hug 
which he knew would tickle her right on the side of her ribs. Both new, she 
could fight him off, but he mean well and she was having fun. He let her go 
so they could go sit at the table. 
Astarion: “This room is basically done except for moping. The barrels are oil.
 The nearest water source is who knows where. We need construction material
 to fix the walls. We could keep sweeping.”
 River: “Phew-… I think this is going to be harder than I though. Hehehehe. 
But, nothing to it, but to do it. Moping-… I got an idea, though we do need a 
water source. How about we focus first on checking the things left around. 
You open the chest and see what can be stored. Then then the rocks for 
walls.”
 Astarion: “Rocks for walls? Do you mean reuse them to fix them up?”
 River: “Yes. It will minimize having to bring things over or having to go out 
there to get some. What do you think?”
 Astarion: “Well, it’s not like we have something else to do. Might as well. 
We could find gold.”
 They began the first step; clean up. Astarion took off to open up the chests 
because he liked the challenge of unlocking the lock. River went to the statue
 and began to check the items around it. She decided to place items in, you 
guessed it, piles. It was easier to see what they had. 
It was surprising to find as much as they did. There was a lot of armor and 
also weapons. There were a lot of barrels of oil, too. She figured they were 
for either lighting or for fighting. 
At the base of the Selune statue was an old wooden wheelbarrow which was 
a great help with moving things about for her. She carried the training 
dummies to the side wall as well as some planks and even a stool. 
River: “Just what were these people doing? All these items are so random-… 
Then again, they didn’t survive, so perhaps that’s why. They were terrified. 
I’ll honor their memory some how.”
 She noticed that there was plenty of wooden planks which she figured had 
been crates at some point. This was useful since she wanted to fix up the 
floor on the hidden room. 
Astarion noticed the lever that opens the porticullis, but they both decided to 
leave it closed for now. They weren’t intending on going outside for now.
 So, all burlap sacks were emptied, crates opened, chests unlocked. Nothing 
was spared. There were so many camp suplies that River was quite happy, 
though very tired, and dirty. So, was Astarion. But they still had the issue of 
water. It was starting to become obvious that they will need a source fast.
River collected books, too. Every book or journal that they found was placed 
in the table in the kitchen. Right now was not the time to sit down and read, 
so they would just be gathered to keep them safe enough. 
The only things that she didn’t dare move were the skelletons. They were 
picked off for only some items were there still around them like journals or 
rope. She wanted to see if they had an identity. Then they would be burried 
up top at the temple. 
At the end of whatever day this was, they were a little sore and back in the 
kitchen where the portal was. River kept looking at it or at least trying to 
from the corner of her eye. Astarion took notice.
 Astarion: “You want to leave so soon, my love?”
 River: “Yes, and no. You know how my mind works. I’m trying to figure out 
a milling things at one time. And I’m wondering how to use our available 
options in the best way possible. So, that portal is one way. First, I need 
water. A lot of it. I don’t know where water is her, but up there, I do.”
 Astarion: “Oh, that went very different from what I was expecting. So, that’s 
what you’re thinking. Haul water in here, but how? Where?”
 River: “That’s the thing. As you were moving the barrels with oil, I figured 
they cannot be used, but what if the goblins left barrels and containers up 
there. Collect them, clean them up, bring them over.”
 Astarion: “Carry a barrel of water here?! The weight alone is insasne.”
River: “Exactly! It’s too heavy. But, what if it’s half the water first. Hear me 
out. I go and check out the area. Collect them, take them to the bridge we 
crossed and wash them there. Then, fill them half way or a little under half 
and carry them back via the portal.”
 Astarion’s face was flabergasted. She really had been trying to figure out the 
logistics of bringing over water. She surely was dead serious about making 
this work. He closed his shocked mouth and gave her a sneaky smile.
 Astarion: “Call Halsin.”
 River’s expression lightened up. Perhaps Halsin or some daring Tieflings 
cold help her scout for barrels and perhaps even initially carry some. It would
 be a lot of work, but it might help.
 River: “Astaion! You are a genious!”
 The smugness he showed would put the most peacock to shame right about 
then. Of course he was a genious. He was Astarion Ancunin after all. So, then
 River got her little stone and established the connection. 
River: “Halsin. HahaHalsin. HALSIN! You’ve got the stone, answer me, 
come on!”
 Halsin: “Wow, wow, Tav! What’s going on? Are you guys all right?”
 River: “Yes… well, sort of. Oh, I’ve got so much to tell you, you all. It’s 
something else, this place. But, there wil be time for this later. For now, I am 
looking to hire whoever is interested in a mission.”
 Halsin: “A mission?! Tav, I don’t thing-…”
River: “No, give me a minute to explain, please. First, there are no goblins 
left anywhere. Second, I am looking for help finding wood barrels. Third, I 
might, and my might I do mean will, need help carrying water down here. 
Finally, would you like to come see? I love this place. It’s dirty, sure. And 
crumbly, too, but it’s perfect! So, what do you say?
 There was a too long silence. Then a booming laughter from Halsin and some
 others. They were listening in and found her enthusiasm about the Underdark
 quaint. 
Halsin: “Sorry, my dear Tav. It’s just-… you always manage to make one 
think one thing and then pull the rug.”
 River: “Sorry. I just-…”
 Halsin: “Don’t take it the wrong way. We just thought something bad was 
happening, that’s all.”
 River: “Oh, no. So, far everything is calm. It’s just that it’s rather dusty and 
messy, and I do need water. But, it has to be surface water because I don’t 
know where the nearest source is down here. By the way, is it day or night?”
 Halsin: “It is day at the moment. You guys have been gone for about 2 days 
by now. But, I suppose no sun down there makes it difficult to tell.”
 River: “It does. We just gage it by my sleeping-… but I take naps, too.”
 They both laughed at this. 
Halsin: “Well, give me a couple of hours or less and I will contact you again. 
I will see who would like to go and help out.”
River: “That’s amazing! Thanks. I can go up and escort-…”
 Halsin: “No need for that. Just wait for us at the temple’s entrance or the 
bridge.”
 River: “Very well. Oh, and by the way. Could you bring the cart please? Will
 all the things in it? I will need things from it.”
 Halsin: “Certainly, Tav.”
 River: “Thank you so much. Love you and you guys, to pieces.”
 Halsin: “Love you too, Tav.”
 Halsin smiled at the last part, a bit peeved that Astarion was not the type to 
share the love, but glad she was thrilled. He knew Astarion was a lucky man 
to have won her heart.
 He then went to talk to a couple of folks and see who was willing to go and 
help. He did push the idea that technically it would benefit all and that she 
had given all her gold, so that was payment in a way. Basically, he took a 
page from her book to work them a bit. 
Meanwhile, she was thrilled but a little nervous. She was certain that at least 
Halsin would bring the cart over with the buckets. That’s what she was really
 after. 
River: “Did you find any buckets by any chance? As you were looking 
through things?”
 Astarion: “No, not really. A lot of swords and a fancy helmet, but that’s all.”
River: “Well, let’s keep going. Right now it’s day time, but by night you can 
come with me up top, too.”
 Astarion: “I’d like that.”
 They continued working. By now, they had moved debri from the top side of 
the outpost down to the porticullis. He idea was to simpy dump it out and 
deal with it later. They would occacionally see movement further into the 
land, but it was of no consequence yet. 
Halsin: “Tav. We are on our way. It’s almost sunset, so perhaps Astarion can 
join us.”
 Astarion: “Stop giving her ideas, Halsin. She hasn’t stopped working me like 
a mule. My hands are dreadful.”
 River: “Stop being such a big baby, my big baby. Very well, Halsin. Thank 
you so much. I really need the water. I stink.”
 River went through the portal up to the top. She disliked the feeling of feeling
 like all of your body would stretch and then contract until you got out. It was 
a strange feeling, but it was certainly convenient.
 She got out and saw that it was twilight. She went back to tell Astarion for 
then to use it together and go back up. They waited by the little wood bridge 
to greet the ones that were coming.
In the distance, Halsin could be seen and a couple more faces that were 
surprising. 
Halsin: “Oak Father’s Blessings to you! Tav, Astarion. Long time no see.”
 River: “Halsin! I’m happy to see you. And my little Helen. And the rest. I am
 truly in debt to you all, but time is of the essence.”
 Astarion: “Of course, but what’s the plan, dear?”
 River: “Right, well first we will-…”
 River began telling them the plan and delegating what they will do. So, the 
took off. Astarion and Halsin stayed near the river’s edge to help with the 
barrels that were found by the other three Tieflings that decided to join: 
Toron, Rikka, and Cal. They were were quick to scout the temple and found 
several useful things. River had told them that she needed anyting that could 
hold and keep water for a long time. Any loot they found was theirs, but the 
biggest task was for them to check out the temple and consider perhaps 
relocating here for safe keeping. 
Halsin thought it was a bold move, smart, but very bold. In a way, it would 
be a way to ease the tensions between the druids at the Grove and allow those
 Tieflings that still wanted to stay, to have a place of their own. Also, the fact 
that Tav or better say, River, was so close by they would be safe. It just 
needed some work to increase the protections. 
So, Astarion helped carry the initial barrels and took them down. River and 
Halsin filled them up and got the near the portal, but Halsin was the one that 
moved through the portal down. The other helpers once they found the 
needed containers, took off to find a cart to carry some useful items back to 
camp. They were excited with the idea presented: help reclaim Selune’s 
temple for their own. It was near enough the Grove and the fact that River 
and Astarion were right bellow, eased their fears.
 Halsin on the other hand was quite entertained. He saw the outpost and saw 
River’s vision of using it as a type of hostel initially. She needed the water to 
clean it up, but the next phase was to begin fixing the broken areas. It was a 
feat, but it anyone could succeed, it was her. He knew for a fact that she will 
expand this idea not only to the temple, but also to the Grove. He’d already 
caught her checking out the broken pillars and broken spaces. 
By the time it was almost day time, they had already finished and had even 
eaten some game Rikka caught. River thanked them and told them to speak to
 Zevlor and Okta about the idea of perhaps settling at the temple. River felt 
that it was a win-win for everyone and it would eventually become a great 
place to create a market. The Grove was more of a sacred space, but the 
temple of Selune needed life back, not scholars with closed minds and up 
turned noses. The Tieflings were sharing the same smile she had and Halsin, 
too. The bid each other farewell and Tav went back down after she saw them 
disappear from view as they headed back.
 Once inside, Tav felt a big relief. She was exhausted, but she neede to wash 
up first. Lucky for her, Astarion had already begun to heat up some water for 
her to wash up. He moved the bucket to the area of the porticullis and she 
decided to wash there. The water here wouldn’t be much of an issue for now. 
He joined her in the washing up. They helped each other with their backs and
 hair. Then they got dry, got dressed in clean clothes and headed to the 
bedrolls in the kitchen to sleep. 
In total, the were able to find 15 barrels, 14 which could be reused with 
water. The other two were oil. They rolled those to a safe space above for 
now. 
After a time, she bagan to stir. She felt sore, but well rested and Astarion was
 beside her. He was awake, but with his eyes closed.
 River: “What are you thinking, my love?”
 Astarion: “Mm-… not much. It’s just that a lot has happened in the last 
couple of months and now we are here lying on the ground like nothing 
major has happened.”
 River: “I know what you mean. It feels surreal to me. One day, I was hunting 
a rabbit and I slipped. I fell and hit my head. I saw how the world faded to 
black and then I woke up in a glass coffin in some alien ship. Only thing I 
had on my was my clothes. My guear gone, weapons, too.”
 Astarion: “Mm-… You never told me about your past life. Well, not much 
anyway.”
 River: “To be honest, it’s because there isn’t much to tell after I was 
banished. Every day merged into a long eternal day and night. The same 
things I did on our way here are the things I did in the forest. Well, minus the 
tent. That one was for you, but very comfortable, so I’m not complaining.”
Astarion: “So, you never had shelter-… even temporary shelter before the 
group?”
 He was surprised. She was very clean and tidy about her tent and even now 
about having the outpost clean. He just couldn’t imagine her being out in the 
woods with nothing much.
 River: “Well, I was not well. My mind that is. I was too wild, I suppose. I 
found good trees and slept there. I had a pack with my things. I carried light. 
And I was always on the move. To be honest, I felt like my clan was still 
trying to hunt me down.”
 He squeezed her hand as she said that. He knew the feeling.
 River: “I don’t know if they were, but I ran and I hid. It wasn’t until the 
parasite and all that where I finally was in another land. So, I was able to 
breathe again. I just observed you guys and like nature does, I mimicked a lot
 of the things I saw. They were strange at first, but then they became my 
normal, too. But, my anxiety remained. Cleaning up helped. It still does.”
 Astarion gave her a kiss on the top of her head. Perhaps she was still feeling 
that way now, but pushed through it.
 Astarion: “Perhaps there are ghosts of our past that will never leave us. But, 
we have each other to fight them off.”
 River: “I’m certainly glad. I told you before; this is my first attempt at having
 a proper home. But, I didn’t know it was going to be this challenging. The 
water problem alone is something to consider.”
Astarion: “I’d like to think it was resolved quite cleverly.”
 She rolled her eyes, but it was his idea, so he was right. 
River: “Always, so smug. But it’s true. Now with the buckets and the portal, 
water can be carried easily.”
 Astarion: “So, about your offer to the Tieflings-… very clever, too. How long
 did you think about that?”
 River: “It came to me when I saw them coming behind Halsin. I hadn’t 
considered it. But then I was thinking that if we are down here, anything can 
come again and claim it. They are intent on going to Baldur’s Gate to start 
fresh, and well the Druids wouldn’t mind having their Grove back. So, I just 
thought everyone can win. We’re near and with the portal, we can aid. The 
Grove is near enough, too. And they can take over the temple and decide how
 to manage it. It could even house more refugees if needed.”
 Astarion: “So, 3 settlements tucked away from Elturgard eyes. Allow them to
 grow and thrive and be for the outcasts. It’s not half bad.”
 River: “Especially that part. The Tiefling folk don’t deserve the hate they get.
 And the spawns neither. None of you made the decision one day to make 
your lives extra difficult. That’s just stupid. So, if I can help balance the 
scales a bit, why not?”
 She had sat up to look at him and he grabbed her to lay her back down on his 
chest. He understood her passion and her conviction. This wasn’t for her 
fame or glory. All of this was because she wanted to belong and she felt that 
if she gave the outcasts a home, she would have a home, too. 
They stayed there a while longer until River couldn’t ignore she was hungry. 
Then she got up and began to prepare something to eat. Okta had added a 
little fruit in the cart, so she ate that. Meanwhile, Astarion helped pick up the 
bedrolls. It was time to keep cleaning. This time it was floors. 
The process was simple. Throw water on the floor, sweep it in the same 
direction towards the porticullis. They both did this from every space 
including the small room with the ladder. 
This first week was just that. Cleaning up the space to make it comfortable, 
or as much as they could. It also gave them a chance to breathe. A lot had 
happened even in the last month. They had to confront themselves and each 
other to find that they wanted to be with each other before the next challenge 
started.
 Even now, they understood that it was more than what they expected, but 
they vowed to take up the task and they weren’t the type to back down. So, 
for now, all they will do is clean up and plan. They have a pending meeting 
with the Tieflings and Druids again about relocating the refugees. 
But for now, all they can do is clean and plan. And as Astarion, calls it, also 
have “a bit of fun” while there at it.
