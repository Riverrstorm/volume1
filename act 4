Chapter 3  
Understanding misunderstandings  
I'm wearing his shirt! What happened last night? What have I done? Did I...? Did we...? But, 
he said he didn't... Oh, Tav,  you've outdone yourself this time! The sun temple wasn't your 
only stupid blunder, woman! I hope he can forgive me. I wasn't thinking right. Oh no. 
"Astarion, I'm so sorry! I didn't mean to take advantage of you like this. I feel so horrible. I 
mean, the last time we spoke and said you didn't... and I'm fine with that. You're my friend 
and I will respect your boundaries and choices. Oh, gods! I feel so disgusted. I... I mean, not 
about you, of course not, but how could I... I mean, I don't remember much after Wyll, and 
then...we were... Where are we? What happened?" 
Looking astonished and a little taken aback, he tried to stiffle a laugh as the realization 
dawned on him. "Oh, no my dear. I think you've slept far too many hours, and you're not 
quite here just yet. Whatever you are thinking or, better yet, what you think we did, didn't 
happen."  
Then he begins to retell the events of last night with luxurious detail to calm her mind and let 
her know that she isn't the "monster" she thinks she is. The only monster right then and there 
was him, the spawn. 
"Well, let's see. Wyll found us once it was dark out and brought us to this tavern-inn. We 
gathered with the rest of the group, along with other survivors of the battle. They laughed 
and drank. But you were simply beat. You started to swagger from side to side until 
eventually, you collapsed. I simply carried you up to a room and bid the rest a good night. 
They're still at the Inn, apart from Wyll and Karlach. Those two have gone back to the Hells to
 keep Karlach from going boom. 
I listened intently, not daring to interrupt his retelling of the night's events. Perhaps, I was 
wrong, and I didn't do what I thought. Sure, I want it, but not like this.  
"So, once up here, I took the liberty of removing everything you and I were wearing in order 
to take a bath. You were so exhausted that you were my little doll as I washed your hair and 
body as best I could. You see, I found it logical to get in the tub right along with you and take 
advantage of the water. Yes, we were naked and wet. But I was as respectful as I possibly 
could be.  Hahaha", he giggled. 
"What? Why didn't you wake me? I could have done it myself, you know. You didn't have to 
go through all the trouble. But thank you."  I told him, but I could feel my body burning like a 
wildfire just at the thought of him taking care of me, even if it was to this extreme. 
A bit incredulous, he softened his gaze and took Tav's hand and offered a warm smile. This 
was new to him, caring for someone who cared back. No one is like that, he thought.  
"Seems like you believe that we made love last night, my dear. I know we did talk about that 
before and I said that I wasn't ready to be with anyone, nor will I know when I will be able to.
 Don't worry, you did nothing of the sort. You kept your word. Also, I didn't force myself on 
you; I just thought that since we had been intimate before, that it should be me who helped 
you bathe, tired as you were and all.  Besides, it was basically impossible to wake you or for 
you to let go of my arm." He looked at her playfully, trying to tease her, while trying to not 
make her more ashamed of the odd situation. 
I am not sure if that is a relief or not, but at least I didn't force myself on him. I want to keep 
my promise and not push. Besides, it's not like I am as experienced as the rest of the lot or 
even him. If they were to find out, I'd be teased and joke about till kingdom come. I don't 
want that.  
"Well, good. I am sorry, by the way. I didn't realize how tired I was. I will make it up to you, 
just say the word and I'll make it my top priority. Also... by the way... thank you for not 
making it a big deal. We hadn't gotten much of a chance to talk after the last time. I want you 
to know that I will never push you to be intimate with mmm... anyone, no matter what. You 
are free, and you have the right to choose. It's your body and no one else's." Tav told him 
while looking down at her legs extended down the bed under the covers.  
"Mm... anyone? Oh, please. I've lived for over 200 years and now Cazador's gone. If I want to 
be intimate with anyone, it will most certainly be you, my dear. You have your alluring 
charms, after all.  Or did you mean, you?", he lifted Tav's cheek to see her eyes while she tried 
to avoid his gaze once more.  
I hate how he is always able to disarm my defenses without even trying. Everyone else just 
stops pushing the subject, so why does he always have to push further? Who am I kidding? I 
can barely lie to myself, let alone lie to him. If prods just the right way, he will open me worse
 than an old book.  
"It doesn't matter. Let's just let this be behind us. Nothing bad happened, and we are well and
 clean, which is all that matters to me. I'll just step over there to get  dressed. Where's my pack?
 Do you know?"  Tav pushed her way with words, trying her best to hide her true emotions. 
She was nervous being so close to him, even more so now that she was wearing nothing but 
his shirt and all he was wearing was a book on his lap, which he had now closed. 
"I'm curious, Tav. Perhaps you can enlighten me. When we spent the night together back at 
the clearing? Why did you go?”   Anxiously, he awaited an answer. His face not hiding the 
worry he carried.  
“I... I don’t know... I guess, I...”, Gods! Why did I go? I could have gone to anyone that night 
of celebration. Gale offered wine. Lae’Zel was clear on her intentions, too. Halsin was even 
more obvious, but Astarion was the only one whose eyes showed he craved to not be alone. It
 wasn’t pity, that’s for sure. I saw myself in his eyes. I was feeling inadequate... alone.  
“Some of the others invited me to their tents that night. I was taken aback by their offers. I 
wasn’t sure how to handle their...request. I pretended to not understand what they were 
really after, I know it is a flaw of mine, to ignore the truth that’s out in the open.” 
Astarion shifted on his seat now fully intent on understanding her thinking process. He, too, 
had noticed she struggled with admitting things to herself. He knew she grasped more than 
she led on, but forced herself to not admit some truths. Likewise, he was curious as to why 
that was, and she was on her way to reveal it. 
Tav continued, “I’ve always known things. I see people, and animals, and things all behave in
 the say patterns. I know when things will break or come out. I’ve even been blamed of things 
that happen because I know where to go or to stand because I just know.” 
She sighed and stared at the ground with her shoulders down as if finally accepting defeat. 
She was ready to bring down her defenses in front of him. 
“When you invited me, I knew what you were after, too. I had connected the dots, you know. 
At that point, you had really messed up. You tried attacking me when we first met. Then you 
woke me up while trying to feed without asking. Everything and everyone was against you. 
You had no one on your side to vouch for you. But it was not pity that I felt for you. I felt 
your sadness... it... it resonated with mine. You felt lonely, and I was feeling lonely and 
scared, too.” 
I wish he didn’t give me that face, those eyes.  He is able to disarm me just by giving me those
 sad eyes. Perhaps If I close mine, he won’t be able to affect me as he always does.  
He stood up and walked towards Tav and stopped right behind her. She could feel his cool 
body crashing with the waves of heat that irradiated from hers.  He spun her around, placing 
a cool hand on her chin, and pulled her face up to look at him. 
“Open your eyes, Tav. Look at me.”, he said almost a whisper. She did as requested. It was 
starting to become almost impossible to defy his requests in this tavern room, where they 
were the only members of the party.  
“I felt we had a sadness that was demanding company that night. I had never done what I 
did with anyone before. It was the first time that I had allowed myself to succumb to my 
desires. I wanted to be with you. I wasn’t scared that you would hurt me because I figured 
you needed me. I was more useful to you alive than dead. So, I went to meet you. I pretended
 I knew what I was doing. I followed your lead despite not knowing how to handle the 
situation. I... it was... I wanted it. I wanted you, even if the reason you were doing it was to 
save your neck from the others. I knew you were using yourself for self- preservation, and I... 
I took advantage of this, too. I’m so sorry, Astarion. I didn’t want my first time to be like this, 
so self-serving, but I was scared. What If that was the only chance I got to be with the person 
who pulled me the most. I feel so horrible, but more so now that I cannot force myself to hate 
that night. I don’t. I wanted you despite it all. Can you find it in you to one day forgive my 
overstepping? I want to do all I can to make it up to you. I swear, it won’t happen again. I will
 always respect your boundaries and I will be on your side. I give you my word.”, she 
stammered half-way through her chaotic train of thought. She was trying hard to express 
what she felt, how she felt, but it wasn’t easy.  
Still holding her chin while looking at her eyes, he gave her a soft smile. He hadn’t expected 
her to finally break her resolve and like a broken dam let her emotions, memories, and 
observations flow out without the filter she usually had. He was glad she let him finally 
confirm some of his own speculations now turned facts. He was her first and she placed a lot 
of value in that. He couldn’t have imagined that in 200 years, he would once again use his 
charms, but this time it felt different. It was different. He didn’t want to share this one. She 
was his and no one else, especially now that he knew she felt so strongly about him despite 
his disturbing past.  
“Tav, was I your first man? Ever?” 
“Yes.” 
“Is that why you started to act so nervously after?” 
“No... yes... maybe... I don’t know. I’ve never been in this situation before. I just knew that 
your past relied on using your body. I shouldn’t have allowed you to do that, but I got carried
 away. I felt lonely, and I didn’t want to feel that way that night. But then, it got complicated.” 
“What do you mean? Complicated in what way?” 
“The more that we got to know each other, the more that I learned from you and from myself,
 I began to feel how my heart skipped a beat. Your laughter, your banter, hells! Even seeing 
you in the distance would make me feel a flutter in the pit of my stomach. So, I began to 
ignore those feelings. You are my friend. You asked me to be just your friend. I may not know
 much, but I do know that I don’t want to lose you. I’d much rather be your friend and stick 
by you than to lose you.” 
“You never cease to amaze me. Here I was thinking so many things that could be happening 
inside that pretty little head of yours, and it turns out that we both... Oh, dear. It seems you 
are right. We both do. How could I’ve been so stupid? Of course, and then I laid down the 
law, and you abided by it. Of course, you would. Who else would, but you? You are you. 
And you’ve been struggling with your emotions ever since. Oh, Tav. I am sorry. It wasn’t my 
intention to create such a mess of things in you.” 
With a shocked and worried look on her face, she wiggled her face out of his hand and took a 
step back. She moved her hands from side to side in negation, trying to clear the air.  
“Astarion, don’t. It’s not your fault. You are simply you. It wasn’t my plan to develop this 
sort of feelings; they just happened. But you need a friend more than anything, and I want to 
be that friend. It’s okay. I’ll get over it, don’t worry. I will never push you to be anything that 
you don’t want to be. You are a free man, now. No one will ever force you to anything 
anymore.”,  she smiled at him hoping he understood that she wasn’t expecting anything from 
him. She was just happy to tag along. 
He stepped forward again, closing the gap between them. He stood taller than before, broad 
shoulders, alabaster skin. His hand reached for hers and held her tight, but not enough to 
hurt her. 
“I think we’ve both complicated things by spending the night. I don’t regret it. In fact, despite
 using it for my own benefit, I haven’t been able to stop thinking about it... about you. I know 
what I said, about wanting a friend, and I do, but... I want you too. But not as a cheap one
night stand. I want to make love to you. I want to hold you. I want to taste  you. I want to feel 
your breathing stop as I make you climax while saying my name. I want you to be mine and 
mine alone. Tav, I want you, but not just your body. I want your company, I want your 
friendship. I want it all and it all to be with you. I know I said that being intimate with 
anyone isn’t easy for me right now, but I want you to be with me and no one else. Is that 
asking too much? Perhaps it is, but I want to be selfish. I need you here with me now, and 
forever, and always. Please, stay with me.”, he said in a desperate plea for her to accept him, 
flaws and all, his eyes full of sadness and hope. 
Oh, my Astarion. You’ve said the words that will bind me to you, so soon. We’re still trying 
to figure out who we are now...what we want. What if I accept now, and then you meet 
someone better in the near future? What if you get bored, and you decide to just being 
friends? I cannot share your love. I will not. I am selfish, too.  
“I can be your friend as you asked me to be, but I will not be one with benefits. Yes, you are 
the first man I’ve ever been with. Yes, to me, you made love back in the clearing. But, I don’t 
desire to use my body for pleasure like many others do without caring who pleasures them. I 
can’t do that. I won’t. I need you to really think about your emotions. You don’t have to give 
me an answer right now. Really do some soul-searching, Astarion. What is it that you are 
looking for? I cannot share you. I will not share you. I’d much rather keep my feelings to 
myself until I can control them than to be a short-lived fling. I can be your friend and stick by 
you on your next quest. I am willing and able to do so, and I am not some sort of martyr for 
doing so, either. I want to help you, but I need you to establish what relationship you are 
looking for. Can you do that? Can you clarify your own thoughts, too? You’ve already pried 
and gotten my true thoughts. Yes, Astarion. I love you. I am in love with you despite it all. 
Yes, I want to be with you and no one else. Yes, I want to follow you through hell and back 
because a moment without you feels like an eternity in darkness. Yes, I am selfish, and I don’t
 want to share you with anyone, ever. So, please. Do me this kindness and land your thoughts.
 What do you want?”, she said with a firm tone, finally accepting her feelings which she had 
been running from lately. She indeed had fallen in love with him, or perhaps the idea of him. 
Nevertheless, there was no more hiding it. How they moved forward from this point on 
would fall on him. This was a kindness she wanted to give him, the gift of choice. 
Taken aback, face a bit in shock, he let her go and walked backwards towards the bed to sit 
down. He wasn’t expecting her to be so strong in her demand. He forced her to admit her 
truth, and  now she gave him the choice to admit his own. He wasn’t expecting to be 
confronted with his feelings  so soon. 
“Tav, you’re right. You deserve to know what I want, especially if it involves you. I know for 
a fact that I don’t want to lose you, but you are right. My mind has been all over the place 
after Cazador. I will do as you ask. I will get my thoughts in order and give you a proper 
answer. I... I love you, too. I’ve never said that to anyone and meant it. Tav, I, Astarion, love 
you very much. That sounds nice.” 
Oh, Astarion. If you only knew that I’d set the world on fire only to keep 
you warm.  
“Well, that settles it, then. Let’s put a pause on this conversation. I need to get some food and 
drink in me and see if the others are still lingering about. I’m thinking that it might be too 
dangerous for you to leave the room right now, so I will get some food and drink and then 
come back up and, well... you can feed on me if you want. I’m suggesting! You don’t have to, 
but I was just thinking it’s been a while since you last properly fed on anything. I’ll be back as
 soon as I can.” 
And with that she darted out of the room, still wearing his shirt with a very pronounced V
shaped neck line. She had just managed to slip into some pants, which also happened to be 
his. The only thing she was wearing at the time were her own shoes. If anyone else were to 
have seen her right now, they could swear she had just woken up from a rough night with a 
vampire. Lucky for her, she at least managed to grab a coin purse to pay for food and 
lodging.  
On a corner table next to a window sat Gale, Shadowheart, and Minsk. On the opposite end 
of the tavern, right at the exit door, Halsin’s large frame was heading out. One could argue 
that Lae’Zel had gone, too. 
Gale shouted Tav’s name while raising his hand to get her attention. She headed to the table 
to touch base. A lot had happened since she last entered this space. 
“Good day...? Is it morning or noon?”, Tav asked while trying to fix the shirt, so nothing can 
come out. 
Gale, with a playful smile, looking at Tav fussing over Astarion’s shirt said,“ Well, aren’t you 
sight for sore eyes? I was wondering when you two would come down?” 
Shadoheart looking at the rest of Tav’s outfit teased her about it, too. “I suppose you both 
were rather busy since last night, given your current outfit and the state of your hair.” 
Misk bust out laughing while imagining Tav and Astarion having a night of passion while 
now Tav now making it obvious. This especially being the case that he too noticed Tav trying 
to pretend nothing was going on between her and Astarion. 
“What?! No! Nothing of the sort. I just... well...”, her cheeks flushed red, and she could feel 
how her nervousness made her knees start to shake. She had to sit down or she would fall. 
This lot can be so unserious. I can’t even wrap my head around my conversation with 
Astarion, and now I’m bombarded with this. I swear one of these days I will be the one 
teasing them for loving someone they shouldn’t. 
“The thing is that he helped me bathe last night. I was so exhausted I could barely move 
myself.” Looking down at the table feeling very embarrassed but determined to be honest, 
she continued. “I know, you guys know that Astarion and I did have... well, you know.” 
Shadowheart interrupted, “Sex, you and Astarion had sex back in the clearing. It’s all right to 
admit it, Tav. Sex is a perfectly natural action two consenting adults can partake in. There is 
no need to be ashamed. As a matter of fact, even Gale and I have had sex, well, if you can call 
that sex.” 
“I showed you another more elevated and sophisticated way of intimacy, Shadowheart. 
Besides, I believe you enjoyed it.”, Gale tried to defend himself while laughing.  
Minks added, “Even Halsin has been enjoying the gifts. I saw him and Lae’Zel, him and 
Shadowheart, and even Gale! Hahahaha Boo saw that one and was horrified! Hahaha.” 
What?! This lot is too much to handle. How haven’t I noticed it before? Did Astarion...? Have 
all of them been...? Great, once again I am excluded from the party. I hope Astarion doesn’t 
tell them he was my first, or they will eat me right up. 
“Oh, I had no idea all of you were so ‘close’ to each other. Well, as long as no one is forced to 
do something they don’t want, it’s fine, I guess.” 
“That’s exactly the reason why haven’t bothered in telling you anything. Halsin and Lae’Zel 
have gone off to find a brothel to relax.” mused Shadoheart. 
“Mm, sounds fitting, I guess. So, anyway, enough about me. What’s the plan? Do you guys 
have any plans in mind?”, Tav said while trying to get the attention of the waitress. She was 
very hungry and thirsty at the moment and needed her energy to feed Astarion in a little 
while.  
Gale explained what they were thinking of doing next. “Well, now that the worms are gone, I 
believe we’ve got some personal matters to take care off. So, I think we might need to split up
 for the time being. What do you guys think?”. He looked a little sad, a small tear forming, but
 he didn’t want to let it fall.  
Shadoheart continued, “I think it is the smartest choice at the moment, too. I certainly have 
some matters to attend with my family and this choice I made with Selune. I will need some 
time to get my bearings.”  
“And what about you Minsk and Boo? What are your guys’ plans?”, Tav asked, already 
knowing the answer. 
“Boo says we should follow Halsin and I think that is a fun idea.”, he mused, but then looked 
at Tav’s saddened face and asked, “What about you? You look sad. Did you and Astarion 
break up? You can follow us instead. It will be fun?”, he said, with a giant smile plastered 
from ear to ear. 
Tav with sadness in her eyes but a bit of annoyance in her voice, “For the last time, Astarion 
and I are just friends. No, he didn’t break up with me... because there was nothing to break. 
And as a matter of fact, he’s in our tavern room because I wasn’t sure how much lighting 
would be in this area. I’m glad I asked him to stay put. Also, I offered him my help to search 
for the seven thousand. They deserve a second chance, and they shouldn’t have to find it 
alone.” 
Gale and Shadoheart looked at her with knowing awe, yet worried look. They had come to 
learn that Tav at times chose to do the right thing despite herself. Perhaps that’s why she was 
so stuck on Astarion. After all, who else would choose to be with the monster and trust him 
so fully. 
Gale, looking a bit shocked, with a smile on his face, added, “I’m not surprised you’d choose 
that. But I must ask, are you sure? It’s certainly not the easiest path to take, especially for you,
 a non-immortal.” 
“And the fact you’d be going to the underdark while trying to shepherd newly freed blood
drinkers. At least Astarion has had the time to practice caution, but the rest of them, I’m not 
so sure.”, Shadowheart interjected, showing her worries about Tav’s plan. 
By this time, Tav’s ordered food had arrived, and she had begun stuffing her face as if she 
hadn’t eaten in months.  
“I know, I know.  And I am not here trying to recruit any of you to come and help. You’ve 
done more than enough and deserve a rest. That and the fact that you guys have your own 
plans to attend to, but that said, I can’t let him do it alone. I was there at the castle’s basement.
 Astarion was so close to becoming a more dangerous version of Cazador and I interfered. I 
feel responsible for letting those prisoners go. I don’t want Astarion to feel he made a difficult
 decision and then leave him to handled it alone. I feel responsible for him and them. I need to 
help anyway I can. Besides, it’s not like I have a home to go back to.” 
“Mm, so you’re willing to put yourself in harms way because you are just too good-hearted? 
Tav, please never change! We need more people like you in this world.” Gale laughed. 
Sheepishly looking at her second plate of food, Tav expressed her feelings for them, too. “I 
don’t want to lose you guys either. To me, you are all like family. I’d be the first in line to help
 you guys out in whatever you need, but I can only do so much. Besides, the tasks you will 
head to do next, aren’t as horrible as fighting a nether brain. Is... is there a way to keep in 
touch once we have to part ways?” 
There was a lump in her throat, but it wasn’t the food. She was sad she had to let them go and
 feared that was the last time she’d see them.  
Don’t you dare cry, Tav. This is what you want. Keep them safe and away from the 
underdark. Keep Astarion safe. Find a way to help the seven thousand. You need to be 
strong. 
Tav looked up towards Gale, hoping he’d have something up his sleeve. He usually did.  
“Well, I suppose we have these enchanted stones. They can serve as a communication device 
even across realms. We could use them.”, Gale placed some crystal stones on the table, which 
glowed lightly.  
“That’s a clever idea, Gale.”, mused Shadowheart. 
“I’ve already enchanted them. All you have to do is activate them by saying the name of the 
one you want to contact. To end communication, just say ‘end communication’ and it will end 
the connection. It’s not the best, but it is what I’ve got right now.” 
“This sounds fantastic, Gale! You reckon I’d be able to contact you from down under, too? I 
mean, what if I want to know how you are doing, or I have a question about some plant or 
animal from over there. I mean, I’ve never been, so … Yeah.” rambled Tav while going for her
 third plate and fourth tankard. 
A bit surprised at the amount of food she was down right absorbing, Gale answered 
while stifling a laugh. “Yes, I think so. I’ve never put them to the test, but I bet they could 
even work in the hells. I’ll see if I can get these to Karlach and Wyll, too. They could come in 
handy while they’re there, too.” 
I hope those two are doing well. It hasn’t even been a day, and I’ve already missed them a lot.
 As a matter of fact, I’m going to miss seeing them every day and every night, especially Boo. 
He’s just the cutest.  
“So, when are you guys heading out?  
“Well, Gale and I were thinking right after eating lunch, but then you came down, and we 
decided to stay until you finished up. Don’t worry, for my part, I’m not in any hurry. As for 
the others, they might stay a day or two longer. They did go to the brothels after all.”, 
Shadowheart mused while analyzing her own communication stone more intently.  
“She’s right. I was about to go out when you came down. But, I am not sure if you’re about to
 finish your meal. Not to put it out there, but isn’t that your third plate of food? If I didn’t 
know any better, I’d think you’re preparing to feed ...” Gale stopped once he saw the look 
Shadowheart was giving him.  
They all knew that occasionally, to keep Astarion from trying to sneak a bite here and there at
 camp, Tav became a sort of go-to for him. She never complained, but her eating habits 
became obvious. Drinking plenty of liquids, potions, and elixirs to replenish health and 
stamina along with foods high in animal protein, in particular liver. Karlach was the only one 
that knew Tav hated eating liver, but it was rich in iron and this was done to keep Astarion 
healthy.  
“It’s fine. You are right. I know I am eating more than my fill, and you also know that I am 
doing  it to help Astarion. Perhaps Karlach mentioned it, but I hate liver. The only reason I eat
 it is because it makes my blood tastier. That and the fact that from books I read, it replenishes 
my ‘supply’ faster. Listen, I don’t want to lie to either of you guys, so I’ll just go on and admit 
it. Believe me, it’s not easy for me, but truth sets us free. I love him. I do. And I know I will 
probably do a lot of stupid actions in order to help him and ensure his safety. After the 
situation with Oblodra, I realized he could smell blood and have a preference. I always tried 
my best to consider your guys’ food preferences and try to have them available. I did it 
because I love you guys, too. That’s the way I show my appreciation, through food and 
drink.” She smiled as she went on about her love language to them. 
“I figured it was you always trying. I always found it odd we would have plenty of fresh 
fruits and vegetables despite having difficult living conditions. Even the campsites were 
meticulously chosen to be as comfortable as possible. I thank you. You made the impossible, 
possible, but at least I never stopped to thank your efforts. Thank you. I, too, appreciate you 
like a sister or perhaps even a second mother. You surely have this strong energy about you.”
 said Shadoheart with touching Tav’s hand on the table. Both smiled at each other.  
“I agree. I am very thankful for your presence and all that you’ve done for us, Tav. I swear, 
you have the patience of a saint. I am sure Astarion will thrive with you around no matter 
where he goes now that he’s free. I will surely miss you all once I am back at Watergate, but I 
do have some personal business to take care of. Let’s not be strangers and use the stones to 
stay in touch.”  
Minsk finally stirred, he had fallen asleep and had been for most of the conversation. Gale 
agreed to find the others and explain the plans and the use of the stones. And so they finally 
decided to head out. Tav ran quickly to the tavern owner to wait for her, since she would be 
running right back. Her items were still in the room and Astarion was waiting for her. She 
didn’t want the owner to think she was leaving without pay.  
She followed the three up until the bridge. They kept up the conversation and playful banter 
until it was time to part ways. Tav, silently crying, hugged her three great friends and patted 
Boo lightly on the head. She kissed them on their foreheads and blessed them on their way. 
They continued their path and crossed the bridge.  
She stayed there for a minute longer until she could no longer see them in the distance. Then 
she thanked the day and the sun for being so kind to her, but it was time for her to go on her 
new path. She gave a bow while a final tear fell to the ground.  
Well, that’s it. No more tears for my friends or the daylight. I made my choice. I choose my 
Astarion and the darkness he must walk in. We are now a package deal, no matter what 
he decides to be for me. I feel happy. 
Tav skipped and jump back the short walk to the tavern-inn. As she opened the doors, light 
poured in, lighting up almost everything and everyone inside. She was glad Astarion agreed 
to stay upstairs with the curtains up.  
She walked to the shopkeeper, who was a little surprised she was back so soon.  
“Thank you for waiting. I do apologize for the inconvenience, but I really wanted to walk my 
friends out. How much will it be for the food, drink, and the room?” She asked with a bright 
smile.  
“That’ll be 10 gold, Miss.” 
“Does it include the room for today, too? We’ll be staying some extra hours. We’ll be leaving 
at sundown.” 
“Yes, Miss. I figured you would leave at dark. It covers everything. And Miss, I’m sorry to 
pry, but are you safe? I think your partner might be a …” he stopped before he could say 
‘vampire’. His eyes surely reflected fear for himself and for Tav. 
Trying to look calm and unaffected with the sweetest smile she could offer, she answered, “I 
appreciate your concern. Really, I do, but you’ve got nothing to worry about. He’s my friend 
and I trust him with my life any day. And you have nothing to worry about for yourself. He’s
 on a ‘vegetarian diet’ of sorts. No people, just wild game. I am a ranger, after all, so I know the
 best places to find the  best game.”  
She paid the man, gave him a wink, and headed upstairs. She was still nervous about 
continuing the earlier conversation with Astarion. She opened the door and was greeted with 
an almost complete darkness. That was until her eyes adjusted to the dim light of the candles 
and oil lamps on some tables and shelves. 
“Astarion, where are you? I can’t see you?” 
“I’m here, darling. I’m on the bed. I’m surprised you're back. I thought you surely had le ...” 
“Left? Where? And without you no less in this time of day? Are you insane? You aren’t safe 
right now  with the sun out.” 
He smiled. She was really doing it, then. She was choosing him and his struggles just because.
 It had been too long that he wasn’t sure if there ever was someone doing so much for him just
 because.  
This idiot is still thinking he can get rid of me just like that. Now, I will be his shadow just to 
spite him then. The nerve of this man to think I’d just leave without my gear. He can’t even 
carry his own pack. As if I were to leave him my junk and then double back to him to get my 
stuff. Honestly, I don’t know what I see in him, but we’re now stuck on proper. 
Tav pouted her lips as she tried to control her mild annoyance at Astarion’s belief that she 
would abandon him in the Inn. Astarion noticed what he almost said had caused her 
annoyance. She always made that face when anyone said something stupid about her. She 
hated it when people projected their fears as hers.  
“I apologize, my dear. It was just me projecting, since I’ve been stuck in this room for hours, 
and I’m starting to get a little peckish.” He gave his characteristic laugh to relax the situation. 
Tav exhaled to control her emotions. She was determined to offer herself for the time being.  
“Apology accepted. But you’ll do well to remember that I don’t offer my companionship 
lightly. I offered my presence and I will keep my word. I’d appreciate it if you stop doubting 
my intent. Anyway, would you like to feed on me for the time being? I mean, it will be a 
couple more hours until we can head out to the nearest forest. I have just had a good and 
sturdy meal which will provide you proper nutrients, too. I need you in your best shape.” 
So this is what Shadoheart meant. I do have a strong aura when I want to be undefied. I like 
this new me a lot. 
Tav thought while giving herself a light smile while standing proudly now next to the bed.  
Seeing her determination and strong presence, he couldn‘t help but feel inclined to accept her 
offer. She smelled succulent, and her efforts and dedication shouldn’t go to waste.  
“Very well, lover. Come and lay with me. Let me make this a little more comfortable.”, he 
almost purred his invitation.  
He knew when he talked like that, Tav’s heart raced, but not in fear, but rather in desire. 
Since he discovered he had this power over her, he relished in the notion that Tav could 
possibly climax by simply whispering sweet nothings in her ear. He might even be able to 
just count numbers, and he’d probably achieve it. He was mischievous enough to try it at 
some point. He tried to stop himself from smiling.  
“You’re doing your planning something evil face. What are you planning to do, Astarion?”, 
she half closed her eyes, showing him she was on to him. 
“Oh, there’s no keeping secrets from you anymore. No fun. But if you must know, I was 
thinking that you must feel a tingling sensation whenever I use my seductive voice. I’d 
probably get you to climax if I whispered numbers in your ear.”, he smiled while give his 
most seductive eyes and pout. 
“You’re an idiot. Now move over, so you can feed. I swear, I’m like your cow, and you’re just 
here trying to make me wet. Idiot.” As she said this, Tav moved her hair out of 
the way, exposing her neck. Her veins throbbed, and d her heart beat faster. She wasn’t 
scared, but rather she knew he was right. And she hated that he knew he could just touch her 
just the right way and she’d be off.  
“Mm, you smell divine, love. Don’t move. It’ll be over soon.”  
His nose felt like ice on her hot skin, and it sent shivers down her spine as he played with it 
on her skin. She wanted him to just bite, but secretly was craving to extend his touch on her 
skin. She wanted him so badly right now, but was not willing to accept this just yet. 
He could feel the shift in her. Her pulse beating faster but her scent smelling stronger of 
desire. He could always tell when his conquests, nay, victims, pulsated with desire. He was a 
charmer and that was one of his biggest weapons, but with her, he didn’t use his 
tactics. Furthermore, he wasn’t trying to woo her, he was simply there, next to her. That was 
more than enough for her, and she was about to have her own little death. That made her so 
desirable to him. If he had had a beating heart, it would match hers.
