Chapter 7 
Into the darkness 
Meeting Halsin put Tav in such a good mood, she had been singing lightly to herself for a 
while.  
 Astarion was also enjoying the walk under the stars. But he was worried about Tav. 
 Their objective, though noble, was dangerous, especially for her. He was worried that seven 
thousand spawn were surely too dangerous for just them two. What if they got to fight? 
Worse yet, what if they got so hungry, he won't be able to protect her? 
 I could possibly take down a dozen and so could she, but would that be enough? 
 He kept walking without getting much peace in the multiple catastrophic scenarios. His face 
was his giveaway, his downturned smile and his furrowed brow were also giving him away. 
Tav noticed. She’d stopped singing for a while now. She began to worry that something was 
very wrong. 
I don’t like that face. That face always means something terrible. The last time he gave me 
that face, he was so broken. He had realized he had fallen in love with me and thought it was 
better to let me go, for he felt corrupted, unreal.  
She decided it was stupid to continue walking, both having scowls on their faces and 
fantasies of dread in their minds. 
“Astarion, stop. Talk to me. What is going on in your head? What’s wrong? I can feel your 
energy is all dark right now. Please, talk to me.”, she said with a trembling voice.  
She was trying hard not to cry, for she was terrified that her own fantasies indeed came true, 
and he was thinking of leaving her. 
 He was startled back into this world, his eyebrows showing his surprise, hand to his dagger 
while getting into an attack position.  
“What?! Where? Get behind me!”, he said, looking around but finding no one else around, 
but Tav.  
 Her face showing her worry and growing sadness from her own speculations, eyes filling up 
with tears. She didn’t want to lose him, but she understood that the task they set out to do 
might make him think it would be for her best. She was terrified that this was something on 
his mind. 
 They were becoming so in tune that she was almost right about her own speculations.  
 “Oh, Tav, my dear. What’s wrong? What … Why are you …?”, he walked over and hugged 
her so tight he was afraid she’d break.  
“Talk to me, my Star. What’s eating you?” 
“What ...? Oh, ... I guess I can’t keep much if anything from you, my dear. The thing is that, 
well, I’m scared... scared that I am leading you in harms way. Before we had more hands to 
fight and do things, but now it’s just us. We are going to the underdark, first of all. And then 
we want to try to shepherd seven thousand spawn into becoming normal again and less 
animalistic. They will be hungry. And you, my dear, are very enticing.” 
“Is that why you’ve been finding ways to make love to me in the wild? To ensure your scent 
stays lingering on me... in me?” 
He was startled. He hadn’t realized she would notice it so soon. Perhaps Halsin let it slip, or...
 was she this observant? He was certainly left speechless.  
“It wasn’t Halsin who told me, by the way. It was your reluctance to me bathing often, as well
 as your new-found hobby of going as deep as you can and letting yourself go. I felt you the 
first time and the last time, I felt it different. Like you needed to enter me further to ensure 
there was no escape of yourself left behind. I don’t find anything wrong with that, really, but 
I wondered why you felt it needed to. It felt as if you were kissing my insides, too.”  
He was taken aback, for he surely thought he was being discrete and here she was retelling 
his actions and not being angry with him for doing so. 
“I … I am sorry, Tav. …. I have been doing just that. The thing is I believe if others find you 
are part of me, like a spawn or something like that, then you would have a better chance of 
survival. Monsters will only attack if they think they can win.”
 “My gods, Astarion! Here I am going crazy, fearing you will leave me here alone and that’s 
exactly what you want to do?! I will not allow it! Not now. Not ever. Please, promise me you 
won’t go.”, she said, her voice finally breaking.  
 Memories of her past came flooding in to her mind's eye. She never told any of them her 
past, but she remembered, even when she was still running away from it. She was terrified of 
being alone again.  
 Tav felt bad, but Astarion had become her anchor in this plane of existence. She wasn’t ready
 to confront her past just yet, though. All she knew was that it terrified her to be left behind 
and forgotten. And for the first time in what felt forever, she wept. It was not the silent cry of 
desperation, but rather the painful wails of someone who had been broken for so long that it 
was becoming impossible to continue breathing.  
Astarion wasn’t expecting this reaction. It was too much for a simple doubt of continuing 
with or without her. He suspected his doubt was nothing more than the final drop in a glass 
that had been filling up for far too long. So, he kept holding her.  
 He thought that perhaps he could hold her so tight that all her broken pieces could mend 
back together, but that was the thing. That wasn’t going to be done in one night, one hug. If 
he were to mend her broken pieces, he would need many days and many nights.  
 “Tav, I’m sorry. It was just a moment of doubt. I wouldn’t dare to leave you.”, he said with a 
lump in his throat.  
 “It’s. . . Not. . . Your. . . Fault.”, she hiccuped as she tried to control herself, but she wasn’t 
able to. 
This sadness had been waiting to find a way out for far too long, and it would not stop until it
 was out of her. She kept crying, while clutching her heart. She could feel the broken pieces 
trying to fuse together, but it wasn’t time for it.  
 This was just the beginning, acceptance. She now knew. So her Astarion simply held her 
there. He waited until she had no more tears left, no more muffled screams. The kind of 
screams that escape the throat of those with a broken heart. 
 After a couple of minutes, she was able to regain her composure. Now some stray tears 
would occasionally trickle down her cheek, but her eyes were still glossy. This was the first 
time that he had seen her truly break. He didn’t know what to say or do. 
 She let go first, and he followed, then took a step back.  
 “Do you feel better?” 
“I don’t know. Maybe. I just. . . My past came running, and it caught up with me just then.” 
“Do you want to talk about it?” 
“Mm. . . Not right now. It’s almost daylight and we need to hurry. We have to find a new 
campsite and keep you safe.”  
“Very well, my love. I can wait, so whenever you are ready, I will be here. I am not going 
anywhere.” 
 They quickened their pace, and she eventually decided to climb a tree to check out more 
distance. She caught a glimpse of a hill that was positioned in such a way that it would block 
the sun rising from the east and at least part of the sun when it was fully on top of them. The 
tree tops would do the rest. In any case, they would have enough shelter, even if it was a bit 
more in the open than a cave.  
She was still tingly with nerves, so she decided to take off running. Astarion followed her in 
silence. He wasn’t sure what to say anyway, so he just ran with her. Then he saw where she 
was headed. It would do.  
They began to set up camp in silence, for the last couple of minutes had been emotionally 
draining for both. That and they were unsure on how to clear the air.  
As they finished up, they both went inside the tent in silence.  
 Astarion pretended to fuss about with whatever book he could grab and pretend to be 
reading, while Tav just sat in silence on the makeshift bed hugging her knees, looking at the 
floor. An occasional sigh escaping her tired body. He was afraid of making a mistake again 
and hurting her. He felt a fool. 
 “Hells, Astarion! You should have known better! Look at her. That’s not my Tav. She smiles. 
She’s clever. She’s. . . She’s. . . Broken, like me.” 
He finally dropped to his knees at the thought that perhaps she was more destroyed by her 
past, and here he was moping and sighing like a fool and making her distraught with guilt 
and sadness. He wasn’t t sure how to deal with this situation or even his emotions. All he 
knew was that he wasn’t going to leave, no matter what happened. 
 She finally raised her head to look at him. Her eyes still red and swollen from crying and her 
voice like a whisper. Nothing like the typical woman she possibly pretended to be. Her true 
form, someone who feels deeply and was hurting now. 
“I need to talk. No, I have to tell you. It’s just not easy for me to do so. I’ve never had the need
 to be open and true. I. . . It’s important for me to open up, to you. It’s illogical for me to give 
myself to you and not let you in. . . It has to be all or nothing.”, she said, looking at him with a
 look that showed him this was difficult for her to do. 
 With the softest voice he could conjure, he stood up and moved towards her. He sat down 
next to her, grabbed her hand and spoke. 
 “You don’t have to tell me anything you don’t want to. I’ll stay with you either way. I love 
you. I’m not going anywhere.” 
 “The thing is that I do. I have to... I have to use my voice. You have taught me that. You have 
taught me so much that it would be insulting to you that I don’t apply it. I have to practice 
what I preach, even if it’s difficult.”, she said while still turning to see him. 
 He was unsure of how he felt about this revelation.  
She’s learned a lot from me? What in the world could I have taught her? 
She already knew how to fight by the time we met? Could she mean sex? 
Even there, I’ve been tame, for I wouldn’t dare use my tricks on her. She’s
 my special one, and she deserves me, not the slave...” 
 “I have learned that it’s okay to let my guard down. That sometimes you need to show how 
you really feel, especially around people who care about you. I have learned that your past 
doesn’t have to define you. That if you were placed in a situation that was beyond your 
control, sometimes you will be forced to do things you don’t want to, but if given the chance, 
you’ll do the right thing. I have to do that. Even if it’s for me, especially if it’s for me.” 
  She said this now, looking at the floor, for she didn’t dare see his worried eyes lest her 
resolve break.  
He didn’t dare interrupt her. He just held her hand and looked at the floor, too. Both with 
their heads down. 
 “I know we all have secrets. That we have things we aren’t proud of or even ashamed of. 
Sometimes the past we carry is the reason why in the present we are so fucked up, you know.
 In my case, I’ve done some shit things to survive, but I could live with it, manage it. But there 
is something that I haven’t been able to process correctly, so it weighs heavy in my heart and 
mind. I know it may sound stupid, sure, but this is part of me. And I am ashamed of how I 
went about things.” 
He was taken aback. He never expected her to be so cryptic about something so important. 
She was usually very direct, and now it felt as if she was going in circles, trying to speak her 
truth while also keeping it hidden. It wasn’t like her to contradict herself like this. 
 She finally looked up to see him, and he followed her lead. She stared at his eyes, to her very 
honest and true. He saw her looking tired. As if she had aged 200 years to meet him on the 
same ground. He didn’t dare look away, and neither did she. 
 “I am a runaway. I am a traitor. I abandoned. I left. . . I left and never dared to look back. I 
was branded a coward, a traitor, and then I was banished. I was just a child, and I was left to 
fend for myself. I was left behind. . .”, her voice barely a whisper, cracked again, and she 
began to weep once more.  
 Astarion hugged her, waiting for the waves of her sorrow to hit him down to his soul. He 
hated to see her in pain, but it was her right to decompress, and she was safe here. He was 
going to be her anchor during this moment she needed him the most. 
 After some minutes, she regained her composure. She took a deep breath and continued, but 
this time she stared at the floor, her head down. 
 “I am 40 years old. By elven standards, I’m merely a child. By human standards, I am 
halfway to the grave.”, she gave a light laugh and a sad smile. 
 He was a little surprised. He always thought she was at least 100 by the way she knew 
things. Though, he didn’t make any remark, just waited for her to continue.  
 “By the color of my skin and other certain traits I carry, it’s obvious I have elven ancestry. I 
am a wood-elf. Well, I am half-elf, the wood kind.”, she giggled at her own wording, 
confusing, but that was all she could do now. Her brain was struggling to be. 
He had at least gathered that much from being with her all this time, wood elf, ranger, 
optimistic, very loving, and in many cases extremely trusting of strangers. Yet, she usually 
had a good pick with her strays, except for Gale. That one could have stayed in the wall. 
Astarion still had a bit of a thing with Gale, for the mage tried to woo Tav at one point. 
Tav took a deep breath and continued, now sounding a bit more composed. 
 “I come from a clan of proud people, broken minds and all, but proud. They are a very tight
knit unit which allows them to commit atrocities to others and to themselves, all for the sake 
of tradition and purity.”, she almost spat that last part out. There was hatred in this 
revelation. 
 “My family, the clan I share blood with, are rotten, especially the elders, both men and 
women. The boys are encouraged to do it because it’s expected, but the men are the worst. 
They just take and take, and you simply have to give because it’s always been that way. We 
have to. It’s our duty, to clean our blood. Imagine that! Keep the disgusting behavior going 
for the sake of purity. Damn them all! I hate them. I am filthy because of them. I am a product
 of their rot, their tradition. I HATE THEM!”, she couldn’t keep herself contained and once 
again wept.  
 She hadn’t been able to process any of this, for she was too young still to give herself some 
grace. Astarion simply held her tight, not daring to let go, for she might break apart into a 
million pieces. 
 He had never heard her hate anyone other than Cazador. He remembered how she had been 
learning a fire spell from Gale before, right after she learned of Cazador’s “poem” on 
Astarion’s back. She mastered it well enough to burn down as much of the palace and of 
Cazador himself when the ritual was botched and the spawn were freed. He could vaguely 
recall her say, “Into the fire I’ll swallow your hate.” as she cast a spell he never heard of 
before, “Igne furia” as nothing more than a faint whisper. But from that whisper, a fire arose, 
a phoenix whose song ravaged through the halls and walls. It came from Cazador’s dead 
body. His fire turned flames and the phoenix rose in flight, touching everything in sight. Then
 the beast was gone. He always wondered why there wasn’t heat coming from the flames as 
the group ran for safety, along with why Tav simply walked out like nothing important was 
happening. Her eyes were fury then, but perhaps it was the flames reflecting in them, but one
 thing was certain, into the fire she swallowed the hate.  
According to Gale, it would be impossible for her to do anything with it, for she was a ranger,
 not a mage. He saw no trouble teaching this to her. Then he comes to find out she did do 
something with it, terrible, but great. He was sure more careful in the future when it came to 
teaching her spells, for he worried she would end up losing her essence with them.  
 But from Astarion’s view point, there hadn’t been any more reason to keep using it, thus she 
hadn’t used it since. Perhaps this was the point where Astarion realized he failed his game of 
seduction. Tav was supposed to fall, but instead he fell for her, for everything she did was 
done in kindness.  
 She calmed down again and pushed forward. 
 “My people. . . They are sick. They. . . They are a cult, I think. The way they behave in the 
world. They do things that are wrong. . . Sick and twisted.”  
 It was difficult for her to simply come out and say it, for it would make it real again. She 
didn’t want to make it real, but she had to say it to let go. 
 “They take advantage of the young and warp their minds to fit the standards. They are 
groomers.” 
She took a deep breath and Astarion simply waited, still looking at the floor, fearing that if he
 saw her eyes, it would break her resolve. She kept hugging her knees and looking at the floor 
while he had his arm around her in a half-hug while still sitting on their bed of pelts and 
blankets. 
“My family practices polygamy. . . incestual polygamy. Even with children.” she shuddered 
at this revelation.  
 Astarion’s mouth dropped. He was surprised that this was even a thing, especially in elven 
folk. He said nothing, but wasn’t sure how to process this truth. 
“I am not sure how long ago this started, but by the time I was born, it was the way. Boys 
would be encouraged to have their way with the girls if they wanted. The girls were expected
 to accept the treatment. We were basically slaves to the way of life. The elders encouraged the
 young girls to go with the flow, and they would laugh it off.”  
Her body gave an involuntary shudder at the memory of what she witnessed. The 
debauchery of a broken people was too much for her young mind, especially since she was 
one of the few or perhaps the only one who couldn’t accept it. It was wrong. It was putrid. 
She was wrong and putrid or so she believed.  
 “Then there were the men who could take and take. It was custom for them to wait for a 
girl’s first bleed to bed them. After all, they encouraged bearing any and all offspring to keep 
the clan alive, the blood going. But also, they had this sick idea that by incest, they would 
eventually erase the human side. Can you believe that foolishness! Of all things holy! These 
monsters wanted purity through the rot!”, her hatred rose once more, for her voice was full of
 malice. 
Her emotions were certainly like waves of an angry ocean, just looking to drown any and all 
that tried to wade through the water.   
 To Astarion, this was the most visceral revelation she had ever given him, and he’d been 
intimate with her several times by now. He was surprised that you could be intimate with 
just words and not just with a naked body. But still, he was worried of what else she might 
reveal for he was certainly not knowledgeable enough to talk her through this, so he just 
listened. He was just there and for her, that was more than enough. She needed this. 
 With extra hatred she continued, “My father, a vile creature, was among the worst. A head of
 house, Clan Storm, the best trained and most deadly rangers. They would wait for any child 
to learn to walk to then start training them. I had my first kill at 7 years old! Who does that to 
a kid?! I was 7!”  
 A single tear streamed down her face. “He was my adversary, a third cousin born too frail. It 
was kill or be killed. And I used a fucken rock! His face still gives me nightmares. He smiled 
when I pinned him down, and he said, ‘It’s okay. I’m free.’ He let me win.”  
She tried harder this time to not let the waves of sorrow hit her again. She needed to continue.
 She hiccuped and took in a breath. Then continued. 
 “He wasn’t my last, whether animal or not, I had to show my worth to my clan. The problem
 with this was I was born a female. Once my first bleed came, I would be transitioned from 
guard to breeder. They coveted the females like me, those that from a young age were born 
strong and cunning. My mother, Varya Storm, was one. She was the last born of my uncle, 
Glaedr Storm. He had a twin who was much more corrupt than most. This one, for I cannot 
call him a man, is called Draeven Storm.” 
 Astarion, was shocked at the name for he remembered a language almost forgotten, and he 
began to understand. He was also taken aback, for she had never revealed names of her past. 
He began to wonder if she was truly Tav Storm. It didn’t make much sense, but he waited for 
her to continue. 
 She hugged her knees tighter as she felt that she was about to fall down an abyss of 
memories she tried to forget, but she couldn’t. This was her burden, but she needed to let it 
go, or it would continue to fester inside her. 
“Draeven was the firstborn of the two. A formidable warrior, but a violent lover, and a worse 
father. He would beat my mom at times when she didn’t want to offer her body to others or 
to him. Sometimes she would be able to defend herself, but by the time I came along, her fire 
was dying. Then I turned 10. She tried her best to protect me from those monsters who took 
and took with violence. At times, she offered herself, if only to keep me safe. . . Keep me 
clean.”  
 Her voice started to shake, but she tried her best to keep it as steady as she could.  
“Then she began to notice Dreaven notice me. He was proud his offspring could all be trained
 at an early age and that we became his deadly weapons ready to do his bidding. But, I was 
his first female spawn.”, she spat this word so hard, even Astarion flinched.  
But, she didn’t mean to insult or shame Astarion. She didn’t want to use the word daughter, 
for she wasn’t born of love. Her father raped her mother when young, and she was the result 
of that abuse. 
 “I was his male-born until he began to notice my body change from a shapeless child into a 
young woman with breasts and legs and all that he liked to pleasure himself with. Vile 
creature that one with his touch lingering too long or his eyes. . . Gods! Those eyes that made 
me feel like he was already making my body his! I was just a child! And my mother knew, 
but what could she do? She was just as much a victim as I was starting to be, or already had 
been.” 
 Her voice broke again and simply allowed more tears to run down, before she kept going. 
Astarion, simply held her with one arm while keeping his horror to himself. Their hell had 
been similar. He never imagined that someone as happy-go-lucky as her lived through that. 
He struggled to not be bitter because of his hell, and here was this woman freely giving him 
her love without restraint. 
My Tav! I didn’t know. Oh, gods! My Tav, what can I do to piece you back together? Who am
 I kidding? I can barely piece myself back together.  
 “My mother knew she had little time left, so she encouraged me to be the best in my training.
 From casting spells to making my own arrows, by the time I turned 13, I could fend for 
myself even in the most perilous woods. I could take down a bear if I had to, and take two 
down just for fun. But then, I began to notice some changes in me. She did, too. My food 
began tasting funny. Varya began to suspect, but it wasn’t until I woke up one day and there 
it was. My first blood. I was too young to have it. That’s when she knew. He’d been using 
roots and elixirs and anything he could get his claws on to speed up the process. My time ran 
out. He was coming for me next.” 
 He couldn’t help but shudder. Cazador was a monster and used him as a weapon, but never 
did he have to be the object of desire for him. Tav was born to be both and just accept her fate,
 for her cult family encouraged it. It was difficult to believe this could be. 
“My mother had to act fast for she knew he had eyes everywhere, so she did the only thing 
she could think of, she branded me a traitor. In the Storm Clan, they’ve got a sigil they use to 
brand the weak or the traitors. It is used occasionally, for you cannot remove it. It is supposed
 to stay on your skin and burn you for being unworthy of carrying the Storm Clan blood. She 
branded me in secret, burned the bedsheets with my blood, and told me to run.” 
And there it was. This was the reason why she broke down back on the trail when she saw 
my face full of worry. She didn’t want me to leave her because she’s been alone all this time. 
Oh, my love! I’m such a fool for every doubting your resolve. 
 “I didn’t understand it then, though. She branded me in secret only to shout at me with 
hatred. She said I was a traitor, that I was planning on killing Dreaven before I got my first 
bleed. She shouted at me to leave and never come back. She said she hated me and hoped that
 I didn’t survive my first night in the woods for I deserve the worst.” 
Her resolve finally broke, and her body shook as the waves of her sorrow hit her like waves 
of a cold, angry ocean. She missed her mother and she felt so lonely for so long that she didn’t
 know how to cope with all this grief, especially now that she was finally willing to open up 
her own Pandora’s box. 
 Astarion was starting to feel lucky his memory of the past was all but forgotten. He was 
afraid to carry a burden like hers around like a ball and chain while also being the grounding 
rock for others. So, he simply held her as her waves became less and less. Now his shirt wet 
with her tears, he was glad he was able to at least be here with her if nothing else. 
“My first week away from home was horrifying. I couldn’t think straight, and my heart 
ached. I barely survived while alone. Then I fell. I was running from I don’t know what, and 
it led me to the edge of a cliff where there was a waterfall. Whatever was hunting me wanted 
me to fall, and it succeeded. I lost my balance and I went down into the white water. I finally 
forced myself to remember all that I learned from my ranger training. I survived. I took all 
my grief, my pain, and my memories and I locked them in a box, to never be opened.”, she 
laughed at this for now she had opened the box to her chosen lover. 
 “I was 13 when I had to fend for myself. I was 20 when I began to understand how cruel the 
world could be. I was 30 when I learned I had a choice to be, and I chose to be kind. I was 
mostly alone in the world, with the occasional pet. At times, I’d go into a town and chat with 
folks. I was craving connection. You see, I can live off the woods. I don’t need to be in a town, 
but the woods are a dangerous place and quite unforgiving. I was so lonely for such a long 
time that I even contemplated going in the water and just stay there forever.” 
 That last sentence shook Astarion. He never expected her loneliness to be so deep that she’d 
thought it better to just... He dreamed of freedom and power for himself as Cazador’s slave, 
but never to end it like that.  
She took a deep breath and straightened her legs. She had held that position so long, her legs 
were going numb. Tav was almost done with her first layer, but was feeling better for it. It 
usually does wonders when you trauma dump your demons, though it’s better if you have a 
willing participant or a journal to do so. 
 He was grateful that she allowed him inside her past, but was unsure on how to continue the
 conversation, or rather her story. He chose to wait for her. 
She shifted her weight just enough to be facing him and grabbed both his hands. 
“I want to apologize for my outburst back on the trail.” 
“My love, you don’t have to.” 
“I do have to. I scared you. I worried you. But the thing is that it wasn’t because of you. I 
need you to know that. You didn’t hurt me. You haven’t done so, at least willingly.” 
 She sighed, but now looked at him directly, locking in on his eyes. How she loved those eyes.
 “I was just tired, and my brain locked in on a feeling I tend to suppress. I’ve been working on
 finding books and scrolls on how to deal with grief, but Faerun doesn’t have much to offer, 
sadly. So, it’s mostly me talking with scholars and old folks whenever they let me.”, she said 
with a short chuckle. 
 “I know now that I do have issues stemming from my past, especially regarding 
abandonment. That’s why I want to apologize. Perhaps it wasn’t your intention to consider 
leaving me in a safe space. I get it. The problem was that you didn’t know this is wound I 
carry. How can you help if I don’t allow you in, you know? At least you’ve had the courage 
to let me in. You’ve taught me the courage to be vulnerable, and I am very blessed for it.” 
 He was surprised, hearing this, him. . . Courage? He never expected to hear the word 
courage and vulnerable in the same sentence being told about him. But, he felt proud of 
himself for that meant that he was learning and growing.  
 He wondered if Tav realized just how much he was also learning from her. He wanted to be 
on his way to being a better man, and she simply inspired him. The thing was that they 
inspired each other to be better, but they didn’t do it for each other. No, they did it for 
themselves, the other simply got the honor to be there as it happened. 
 “Tav, thank you. Thank you for trusting me enough to reveal the past that still hurts you 
now. I don’t think I have the words to help you heal, but I have the desire to stay with you as 
you continue in your healing, just like you have been doing for me. I hope the love I have for 
you is enough to help you know you are not alone anymore. I love you, beloved.”, he said 
with the softest of whispers in her ear.  
He was certain that if his heart could still beat, it would be for his Tav, especially now. 
 “Oh, Astarion! I love you. I know I’m not easy, but thank you too for just being and for not 
forcing me to be anything else other than myself. I know I can be too much sometimes and 
you, well... I’ve always thought we are like light and dark, day and night, pun intended. I 
mean, you tend to be, well, you and I think our personalities shouldn’t be compatible. You 
have your way and I have my way, and it’s just illogical for us to be together, and then you 
are a vampire, and I’m. . .”
