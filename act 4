Chapter 19 -  We’re home.
 As they waited for the sunset, people came and went. Tav requested 
permission to leave the cart at the grove along with some big items 
like the tent. They would be kept by Halsin for safe keeping, 
especially since the tent was a magical item. 
Tav also was able to trade her salted fish for other dried red meats. 
She was even able to get some bread and cheese. Though, she wasn’t
 scared about food. In case of emergency, they made the plan to come
 back up, and they would also have the communication stones Gale 
gave them. Halsin had his. He had begun to wear it as a necklace and
 he fashioned one for Tav. She loved it, but Astarion not so much. So,
 as a compromise, she wore it as a bracelet instead. Halsin laughed at 
the solution for he made a necklace to tease Astarion and he knew it. 
Once the time came, they said their “see you later” to not jynx it. 
Besides, this was a recon mission. They were told that the goblins 
were not able to gain enough force after the last battle and most 
stragglers had gone. The Shattered Sanctum should be mostly free of
 anyone by now. So, they took off for it. 
They were on high alert but the light of the moon helped them see 
clear enough, him having a better view of course. But she wasn’t too
 bad. Their weapons were at the ready and their backs weren’t too 
heavy. This time, she carried only one water skin for drinking which 
was full and the others were empty and tucked away in Astarion’s 
pack.
 The cool night air was refreshing, though. The trees’ leaves and 
branches swayed a little. It seemed like a calm night. They 
ocassionaly herd the little noises form gnolls at a distance, but they 
were easily dispatched if they got near. After the 7 kills they gave 
them, they were certain that their scent was now a known threat. For 
now, the gnolls were not going to get near. 
As they kept walking, the vegetation began to thin. They were near. 
They didn’t talk tonight. They just paid attention and tried to 
remember the last time they had been at that area of the forest. Then 
they saw what they wre looking for. The saw the stone bridge with 
studded wooden barricades. No one was manning them. It was 
eering to see it dark and abandoned. The last time it was full of life-..
 but they saw to that. Then Tav broke the silence.
 Tav: “I’ll have to clean up.”
Astarion: “I’ll leave you to it.”
 Tav: “Funny. You’re helping. We gotta clean your den of 
debauchery.”
 Astarion: “Ha ha. I’m a changed man. I swear, mother.”
 She laughed silently at this. She recalled how he was entertained last
 time they were there about enjoying the horrible mess the goblins 
made. But Tav didn’t like the mess. She thought it was a nice place, 
too nice to be destroyed that way.
 Then they got to the main entrance. Still nothing. No noise, no fires, 
just eerie silence. Though nothing much had changed in décor. The 
tunnels were still there, too.
 It just smelled like the forest had reclaimed this space once more. It 
was just the smell of the trees and moss. Dust and dirt layered 
everything that was out in the open. 
Astarion and Tav had their orders. No prisoners. No survivors. The 
problem if still there would be deal with. They walked through the 
center courtyard trying to not make much noise as they walked. The 
memories were coming back. They knew where to enter the 
Shattered Sanctum now. 
Keeping north of the courtyard, as they walked, they finally saw the 
Heavy Oak Door. There was no one guarding it now. The Shattered 
Sanctum was straight ahead.
 Astarion was about to open the door but Tav stopped him. She was 
on edge thinking that there might be a trap. So, they checked for any 
signs of tapering. They found none. He opened the door and they 
stepped in. 
It smelled like you’d expect. Goblins aren’t known for being clean 
and tidy and this place had likely been abandoned for about a year. 
Also, gnolls aren’t too picky about their food sources, so think about
 that after the battle with the goblins. 
Tav wanted to walk straight ahead, but instead just went to the right 
side to get to where she wanted. She found some things that could 
topple over, so she let go of her first arrow. She wanted to get it over 
now. If there were stragglers, the noise would surely wake them. 
There was a loud bang as the items fell. It was some wooden crates 
and armor pieces that fell to the ground. They waited for any 
reaction. There was nothing but the echo of the noise she had caused.
 As they kept walking, Astarion saw a war drum on the floor. He saw 
Tav and she agreed by nodding her head. He hit the skin hard to 
make as loud a noise as possible. Still nothing. The goblins were 
either scared or gone, but nothing but silence met them. This 
convinced them that indeed at least here there was no life left.
 They kept walking towards the next set of oak doors which lead to 
the Defiled Temple. This time it was Tav who opened these doors to 
enter. As she touched the wood of the door, she felt a strange little 
jolt of energy enter her body trough her hands. 
Tav: “Oh! That was odd.”
 Astarion: “What? What’s wrong?”
 Tav: “I got shocked by wood-… I think. Nevermind, let’s keep 
going. The room is nearby.”
 Astarion: “So, it’s coming back to you then? Good to know.”
 Tav: “I’m in the zone. And I’m tingly. I’d run, but I hate running.”
Astarion just smiled at that. She really did hate running. 
The last time they were here, this used to be Gut’s personal 
chambers, but she was dead now. And both were hopin Polma was 
dead or gone. So they took the right until the end of the chamber and
 then took the left. And sure enough, there was no one. 
They were still expecting anyone to pop out of somewhere and 
attack, but nothing. That made it worse. They were still on edge. So, 
Tav stopped him. He looked startled, he though she something that 
he hadn’t seen.
 Tav: “We need to calm down. We’re getting clumsy. Let’s wait here 
and collect ourselves before continuing.”
 Astarion: “Very well.”
 She sat on the dusty floor and a little puff of dust lifted as she did. 
She began to caugh and swat her hands at the dust. Astarion began to
 laugh and he too caught the cloud of dust and began cough-laughing 
along with Tav. 
As the dust settled, they were more relaxed. Their noise hadn’t 
awoken anyting nor attracted anything to them. This was good for 
this used to be a guarded room-… well if you could call it a room.
 Tav began to talk nonsense to him just to get herself distracted a bit 
more.
 Tav: “So, how are the kids? And how’s work? And the wife?”
 Astarion: “No. Fine, and crazy. I think that’s about right.”
 Tav: “Good. Good. So, no worries about sending them kids off to 
Gale’s school.”
 Astarion just rolled his eyes at her while still leaning on the wall 
with his arms crossed. Tav just smiled at him from the floor. 
Tav: “Say-… do you think that maybe that it’s empty, that perhaps 
we could-…” 
Astarion: “Well, it’s rather big, but as an entrance to it, doesn’t 
sound half bad. It will be a lot of work to clean it up and spruce it up,
 though.”
Tav: “You mean it! I can clean it and if I make more coin, I can hire 
them kids to help clean up, too. Give them something to do-… other 
than ask me a million questions.” 
Astarion: “Tav, our entrepenuer choosing child labor. How quaitn.”
 Tav: “I won’t force them-… I’ll convince them with my charming 
ways and coin! Good ol’ coin! hehehe”
 Astarion: “Scary thought to consider your new empire of employed 
children.”
 Tav: “What-… it will teach them skills such as clean and clean 
faster, but better.”
 He gave her a smile. He knew she was kidding, but it wasn’t past her
 to really employ the kids to clean up for coin or the kids to say no. 
Especially the one that had a little shop. That one was tough.
 Astarion: “So, ready to go, love?”
 Tav: “Yes, please. A little help?”
 She extended her arms for him to lift her up. He did and kissed her 
once she was up. She threw her arms around his neck letting him 
know that she wanted a little more. He gave in, of course. 
Astarion: “What was that?”
 Tav: “Let me be. I like to kiss you anywhere and any place.”
 He made a smirk as he turned to walk through the door and headed 
down the stairs right into the Defiled Temple where the puzzle was. 
As soon as they got there, they saw the puzzle on the ground. It had 
been moved, so the hidden door was closed again. 
Astarion even tried the lever, but nothing. They had to solve it. Tav 
sat down on the floor again looking at it for a bit. Then realized that 
the moon light was hitting one of the circles. She remembred that the
 last time it had been Gale and Karlach who found the answers, but 
those things were gone now. So, it was down to her memory and 
Astarion’s luck. She knew for a fact he hadn’t payed attention to the 
puzzle before. 
So, Tav stood up and began to twist the circles to gather the black 
ones on one side then the white ones on the other. She first tried the 
white ones on the circle of moonlight. Nothing happened. Then she 
tried again, but this time with the black ones. Something clicked and 
moved somewhere. Astarion tried the lever and it opened the hidden 
door. 
Tav stood up and this time dusted herself off before heading forward.
 Astarion waited for her to walk over to him. She kissed him on the 
cheek. She was feeling excited. 
Astarion: “Ready, love?”
 Tav: “Very. Let’s go.”
 As they walked, there was little light, but it was enough to still see 
the area around. Moving forward they eventually got to the doorway 
with the symbol of Selune on top on the rock wall.
 Tav: “Oh, that’s pretty. Has that always been there? I don’t 
remember. 
Astarion: “I swear you’re hopeless.”
 Tav: “What? Why? It’ just pretty that’s all. Oh, shut up.”
 They finally go to the ladder. Tav did a couple of stretches to move 
climb down. They were basically there. So, now at the little wooden 
platform, they were ready to finally reach the Underdark. 
Tav: “Was this thing this unsafe looking before?”
Astarion: “I wouldn’t know, but it’s probably as old as me if not 
older.”
 Tav: “We should have it inspected to see if it holds or just replace it 
eventually. I don’t want accidents of my bebes.”
 Astarion: “I will go down first and you’ll go down after me.”
 She looked at him with suspicion.
 Tav: “Don’t look at my bum, perv.”
 She poked at his stomach while laughing. But he grabbed her hand 
and pulled her in for a kiss. 
Astarion: “No fun. It’s the best view.”
 Tav: “Is it hot in here or is it just me?|
 Astarion: “It is you because of me.”
 He swept her of her feet as she put her arms around his shoulders 
and leaned in for another kiss. There was something about this place 
that was making them all giddy, but they didn’t know why. They 
weren’t complaining either. Who was going to see them acting like 
fools down here?
 Astarion: “I swear woman. The things you do to me. Let’s go.”
 Tav: “Oh, you love it.”
The climb down was long and tiring on her arms. She was glad he 
was below her, though. If she slipped, he could try to help. He dind’t
 feel the same kind of tired she would have. 
After what seemed like eons, the smell started to change a little 
more. They were almost on the ground. She was glad. Then the 
ladder came to an end and Astarion helped her down. He knew her 
arms wher sore. 
Astarion: “Are you all right to continue, love?”
 Tav: “I don’t mind a little rest. I feel-… odd. Like, a ringing in my 
ears and my stomach is-… I don’t know. But, I need to sit down. I’ll 
be fine. I think it was the trek down.”
 Astarion looked a little worried, but there wasn’t much he could do 
now for her. So, sitting was the best thing to do. They moved past 
the gate and she decided to sit in the center of the floor looking to 
the statue. She realized she hadn’t seen it before, they had gone 
around through the window and had seen all those poor drow 
petrified. It had been a tough battle but they defeated the spectator 
monster.  But now, there was no one else but them. She patted the 
floor next to her for Astarion to sit with her. He did so, reluctantly. 
He didn’t want to sit on the dusty floor.
 Tav: “So, what do you think of this space? Does it ring like ‘home’ 
to you? It sort of does to me. I don’t know what it is, but I feel-… 
safe. Calm. Electric. Do you feel it? It’s weird. I’ve never felt this 
before.”
 Astarion: “Well, perhaps not entirely to your extent, but a little. 
Perhaps since the goblins were defeated, the magic of this place is 
returning.”
 Tav: “But what is this place? It looks like a temple and all, but for 
who? Do you know?”
 Astarion: “I do. Her name is Selune and this here is Selune’s 
Outpost. It is a direct entrance to the Underdark, Shar’s domain.”
 Tav: “REALLY?! HAHAHAHAHA. This is Shadowheart’s business
 then. Before the hair and after the hair. Yours looks better, though. 
Very handsome. Very distinguished.”
 She teased him. She knew he was many things, but vain about his 
looks was his top. 
Astarion: “Ha ha. Funny-…”
But before he could finish his sentence, Tav pinned him down. He 
was shocked, but into it. It wasn’t common for her to initiate 
anything. In the past, it was mostly him, in dark secluded corners. 
Back then they were still pretending to not be anything but fuck 
buddies.
 Tav: “Do you remember when we would sneak around? We don’t 
have to sneak around like bandits anymore.”
 She gave him a mischevious grin. He knew that look and he was not 
very willing to stop her. Though it was too dusty for his liking. 
Beggers can’t be choosers, here.
 Astarion: “Tav my dear, I’m all down for it, but the ground is so 
dusty.”
 Tav: “Then let’s stand.”
 He stood up and helped her up. Then dusted each other a bit. Then 
Tav went in for another kiss. It had become a habit of theirs to have 
their little fun in places like this, so now it wasn’t surprising. 
Their kiss intesified by her own accord. She felt this energy coursing
 through her body and just couldn’t stop. So, much so that she bit his 
lip. Then she stopped and looke at him with a surprised look.
 Tav: “I’m so sorry! It’s just-… I-…”
 Astarion’s resolve broke. It was rare for her to be so rough with 
foreplay that now that she had done it, he felt the same energy. He 
began kissing her passionately as he walked her to the nearest pillar. 
Her hands where all over him, his hair, his back, but landed on his 
bum. Her favorite part to look at when he wasn’t looking. She 
squeezed with both hands. He smiled as he kissed her. Then he 
stopped to look at her. 
It was now a ritual to ask “Can I…?” with a simple look before they 
proceeded to do anything more intimate. She said yes. She had 
started this and was pulsing with engergy. She needed that release he
 knew how to give. So, her hands went to her own pants to undo them
 and then to his. He was still pinning her, lightly, to the wall. She then
 found him and began to move her hands to warm him up. Not that he
 needed much warming, the bite on the lip was enough and the 
kissing kept it going. She then guided him inside. A little gasp 
escaped her lips. He smiled wide at that for he knew that he was cold
 where she wasn’t. It always gave a little jump until she heated him 
up to feel alive again. She held on to him for a minute without 
moving. She didn’t want to come to early, so letting her body adujst 
to him was necessary. 
Then he began kissing her again and she matched the energy, her 
hands now back on his bum pulling him towards her. That was the 
confirmation he wanted. He began to move and she began to bite her
 lip. She didn’t like to make a lot of noise unless she couldn’t help it. 
He liked to make it impossible for her to keep quiet. He usually won.
 He began to intensify his thrusting. She was now holding his back 
trying no to let her knees give out. Her head leaning back in 
pleasure, showing her neck. He bagan kissing and suckin on it while 
he was making her arch her back. Then she said his second favorite 
line.
 Tav: “Feed.”
 Her gasping breath a very faint whisper. She was enjoying this 
release as he made love to her while startled in these ruins. So, 
grabbed her from the wall, holding her close to him. He stopped 
thrusting for an instant as he was inside her to then bite down on her 
neck. He wasn’t hungry, in fact he was rather full, but her blood 
gushing down his throat like this in this place was excilirating. 
She was right about feeling electric. There was something going on 
tonight and they both were feeling it. He just took two gulps this 
time, and licked her wound and then began to thrust again. This time
 harder and faster than before. She was already like putty in his 
hands, so this took her right the edge. He caught her orgasm with a 
final kiss and she caught his own. He climaxed along with her and 
then they seperated.
 She giggled as he looked at her with loving eyes.
 Tav: “That was intense. Let’s do it again sometime.”
 Astarion: “Seriously woman. Unless we focus, we will get nothing 
done. But yes, let’s do it again.”
 He laughed too as he stepped back to fix himself up. 
So, it began. The first bite. They didn’t know it, but soon will. This 
was the beginning of their next stage in their life.
Now that she had released some of that weird energy she was 
feeling, they decided to investigate the adjacent rooms before the 
main chaiber where the statue was. Tav was clearly avoiding it, but 
Astarion wasn’t going to push her. He knew she was really inclined 
to make this space their home base, so there was no hurry. 
Astarion went inside the first little chamber that had the iron gate 
unlocked to check it out. There wasn’t much to see but there were 
some oil barrels right near the gates on both sides. There were a 
couple of iron torches on the walls, too. Astarion began to light those
 up with a bit of the oil and a flint and steel he had. 
Tav was just analyzing the space thinking how she could match it to 
the little cabin she had in her head. She was smiling from ear to ear 
and Astarion was just fascinated towards her attitude. He had never 
seen her so happy. He was amazed how this place, being so dark and
 dusty and clearly in need of a lot of work, could make her so thrilled.
 He could feel how her energy was building up again. Next thing he 
knew she was like Karlach. She couldn’t hold still so she was 
dancing in place. 
Tav: “This place is perfect. Look, we can remove the gates or maybe
 just wall them up with wood for privacy. Then put some rope here 
and add curtains-… maybe. A sort of fancy window? I’m so excited”
 Astarion: “Darling, do be careful. The brazier is right in the middle 
of the room.”
 Tav: “Not to worry. I’ll just move it a bit and that’s it.”
 She tried to move it towards the fenced wall, but the floor was too 
dusty, so she kept slipping. Then she began to pull instead. Astarion 
just stared at her and then decided to help. They moved the 2 of that 
room that was to the left of the chamber looking towards Selune’s 
statue. 
Tav: “See. It looks better already. Can you light these two please? 
And I’ll love you more than ever.”
 She called out as she went to check the broken fence that lead to the 
Underdark. She saw a glimplse of the petrified bodies remaining, but
 she focused more on the fence on the ground and the destroyed wall.
 She was already thinking about how to reuse materials and bring 
some down here to begin fixing her new claimed home.
Tav: “Astarion, you reckon the Selunite people will come and try to 
reclaim this place. I mean, it looks like it’s been years alone. I want 
it. It will be our cabin! HAHAHAHA IT IS OURS FOR THE 
TAKING!” 
She said a little louder pretending to speak like a pirate. She was 
really into the idea of claiming this as her new home, despite its 
dilapidated state. You know what they say, “stay with the one of the 
process and all.”
 Astarion was in a way starting to spiral again despite Tav’s 
enthusiasm.
 This woman can’t be serious about her joy right now. This place is 
horrendous. It practically ruins and dangerous and she sees it like 
prime real estate?! 
She noticed he was making the face he made whenver his thoughts 
were getting the best of him. So, she walked over and hugged him 
tight. Then spoke her truth.
 Tav: “My love, I have never had a home. I was never loved or at 
least shown that I was loved. I always had to fight to keep living 
another day. I had been alone all my life. But then I met you and the 
others. I learned that people who are trained soldiers don’t have to 
behave like animals. And that there is space for scholar type warriors
 like Gale. Rikkon would have loved him. The thing is that in the 
time I have spent with all of you, I fell in love. You have taught me 
what love is and it feels fantastic, but I wondered if I would one day 
be able to have what others have. I wanted a home. Don’t get me 
wrong, I enjoy the tent and travelling. But I would at least like to try 
something more permanent, even if it’s for a time. And I feel that 
this place is great. Is it the best? No. Can it be fixed? Maybe. But, I 
want to try. And you know what’s better? I get to do it with you 
knowing that I don’t have to worry about the sun coming through. I 
can focus on other things and not have to be constantly checking if 
you will be all right. You won’t have to be stuck in a cloth cage. 
Besides, my dream cottage is just a dream This-… this is real. I’m 
already thinking of how to add more privacy to the walls, and we 
can rebuild those, and-…”
 He hugged her tighter. He needed to hear that. He knew that she was 
stopping his spiral, but she did it with her truth. She wanted this with
 all her heart. And the only reason she wanted it was because of him. 
She had told him before if he wasn’t part of the picture, then what 
was the point. This was because she wanted him in it.
Astarion: “Fine. You win. Let’s make this our home, my love. We’ll 
rebuild and claim it. And we won’t let any Selunite scholar or 
anyone else try to come and claim our home. Tav? Thank you, for 
everything you do; for everything you are. I never imagined this for 
myself in the long life I was forced to live, but now I want it all. 
Perhaps, that’s why I have lived so long. I was waiting for you.”
 She lifted her head to look at him with such tender eyes. She loved 
that man and it was rare for him to open up about his desires. 
Tav: “Then trust me when I say that I want it all with you. 
Everything. All the good and the bad. I am making no sacrifices 
here. Never forget that. I am here because I chose to be here. I am a 
day walker, sure but I can also walk in darkness. I will always 
choose to walk beside you no matter where that leads. But, tonight it 
lead us here. And we can claim it as our first home. Also, it’s huge. I 
imagined a cottage much smaller than this. This place is large. I bet 
4  cottages! That’s crazy!”
 Astarion: “Four?! What in the hells? What is it with you and small 
places?”
 Tav: “What is it with you and large ones? Besides, this can be the 
palace that you like-… I think you like.”
As they were talking, they hear a loud bang and a couple of swoosh 
sounds coming from the room with the statute and they looked over 
to the outside and saw that the defence mechanisims were still 
activated. They were as powerful as ever.  Tav looked at Astarion 
with excitement. 
Tav: “They work! Let’s keep it.”
 Astarion: “I’m not so sure about that Tav. It could very well attack 
us, too.”
 Tav: “I don’t know. I get the feeling it won’t. But, we’ll check it out 
later. Let’s go check out the other room over there. I’m thinking 
divide them into 2 rooms each. That makes 4 smaller ones. Come 
on.”
 He followed her, but was still a little aprehensive about the statue 
beign active still, but was forcing himselft to trust her. The other area
 had a locked gate, so Astarion had to use his skills to pick the lock. 
This room was just like the one before, but had an adjacent room 
with a broken floor and wall. There were still plenty of things left 
that she would later check out. Since the last time they were here, 
they went directly to the Underdark via the broken wall, they hadn’t 
looted anything. 
Plenty of chests, barrels, and crates were there collecting dust for 
years. But, she wasn’t too interested in that yet. She wanted to check 
out the space and see what she was working with. 
Tav: “Oh! This can be our bedroom. It’s tucked away. We’ll just fix 
the floor and the wall and it will be perfect.”
 Astarion: “Mm-…  wonder what sort of goodies are in those chests, 
too.”
 Tav: “You see. You too are hopeless. Hehehe.”
 He rolled his eyes at her for teasing. He would peruse the chests 
later. Then Tav went through the hole in the wall, down to another 
little chamber where the entrance was actually in the main room 
where the statue was. She just jumped and then climbed down.  He 
decided to go around instead. 
This place was a sort of common area with some working tables and 
benches and it had a fireplace on the opposite side of the torn wall. 
Her face said it all.
 Tav: “My kitchen. My living space with pillows for friends. 
Astarion, it’s perfect! It’s beautiful.”
Her tears of joy now falling. She was beyond herself. It was better 
than her dreams. Astarion walked to her and lifted her up in a hug. 
He was also beyond himself. Her reactions to everything were more 
than what he had hoped for. Here he thought it would be difficult for 
both to adjust to living in the shadows and there she was marveling 
that her dream was nothing compared to this abandoned place. She 
trully did see the beuaty where others didn’t. 
Astarion: “I’m guessing you won’t take no for an answer, now.”
 Tav: “I can take it and the I will put it in the trash. This is our house 
now. Anyone that protests can fight me.”
 Astarion: “All right, my fighter. Are you ready to go meet her, 
now?”
 Tav: “Yes-… no-… I still feel strange. Like I’m being pulled, but not
 in a bad way. It’s like-… there is no turning back now. I don’t know 
what I’m saying.”
 Astarion: “Tav? Are you scared? We can always go back up, and-…”
 Tav: “No. I wan’t to stay. I like it here. It’s not about this place. It’s 
about me. There’s something inside me that compels me to stay. I 
feel like I have to swear an oath or something. Hahaha. That’s just 
stupid. I’m not Wyll or Shadowheart. I’m just me. I’m a nobody that 
walks in the shadows of the forest. I cna’t-…”
Astarion: “You are somebody to me. As for the other things, I 
honeslty don’t know what to say. I don’t feel the same pull you do.”
 Tav: “And that’s fine. I don’t know what I feel, because I’ve never 
felt this. Like there is this energy coursing through my body. It 
almost feels like when I touch you and I feel how my heart skips a 
beat. Look, touch me.”
 She held out her hand and he took it. He felt it, now. She was almost 
shaking as if a large amount of energy was coursing through her 
body and into him. Even his ears started to ring. He even felt it in his
 teeth. But it didn’t hurt. The sensation was the strongest in his 
stomach as if a force was moving him towards the statue but it 
wasn’t strong enough to move him. It was as if it didn’t want to 
force him. It was simply inviting him to go. 
Astarion: “Mh-… Now I know what you mean. I can feel it, too.”
 Tav: “You think we shouldn’t be here? I really want to stay. I don’t 
want to go.”
 Astarion: “Tav. Come here. Sit with me.”
 She went to sit down, but stared at the floor. Then she leaned on his 
side resting her head on his shoulder. He knew this would help 
ground her. She mind was all over the place and was spiraling, too.
He held out his hand and she took it. His cold skin cooling her hot 
hand. She squeezed it tight. She was glad she had him. 
Tav: “I am really sorry for everything that you had to endure for so 
long, but I am thankful that I got to meet you. I feel very blessed that
 you have me the chance to prove to you that I can be a worthy 
partner, especially now that we are about to start our next chapter. 
That’s a lot of bebes.”
 Astarion: “I’m worried, too. But, I agree about meeting you. I was so
 angry for so long. No one answered my prayer. Then the next thing I 
knew I was in a box. I broke out. I fell. I woke up and it was 
daylight. Then one day, out of nowhere, this woman comes walking 
followed by some other fools. And she offers to help! Of all the 
things, she agrees. Mad woman. And I threatened to kill her.”
 Tav snorted. She remembered the same up until that part. She knew 
he wouldn’t. He was scared, too. 
Tav: “You weren’t going to do it. I called your bluff. In the wild, you
 only threaten when you are scared. Then you distract and take off 
running. You didn’t do that. It intrigued me. Also, you were very 
handsome.”
 Astarion: “Am I not handsome now?”
Tav: “Well, actually-… I think you are more handsome now. You 
smile more and your eyes don’t look sad. I even dare to believe that 
you know what happy feels like.”
 He wasn’t expecting that answer, but it was true. In the last couple of
 months, he was more jovial. In the last month after the deafeat of the
 Netherbrain, he did feel like his world was going to crumble now 
that he had to return to the shadows, but Tav didn’t want to leave his 
side. She made the darkness better. 
Astarion stood up and took her hand for her to stand up, too. He 
looked at her and smiled. 
Astarion: “Tav. You have been the single best thing that I have 
stumbled upon in my long and weary life. Being with you this last 
year has shown me more than 200 years in my hell. You have shown 
me compassion, acceptance, trust, beauty, and love. You have taught 
me so much about what it means to be alive. You have accepted me, 
fully, even at my worst. You have been so patient and so kind with 
my and you now want to pass on that same love and compassion to 
the people I unknowingly helped create. I don’t know where you’ve 
come from, but I don’t want to continue my journey without you. 
Tav of the Storm clan. Will you marry me?
 He had gotten on his knee for the last part. Tav, stopped breathing 
and her knees finally gave. She fell. She was in shock. 
Astarion: “Seriously woman, here I am pouring my heart out and 
you topple over like a plank.”
 Tav still in shock, was mumbling something while trying to hold on 
to the table to stand again as he helped her up. Then he heard what 
she was saying. “That’s not my name.” Over and over again.
 Astarion: “What?! What in heavens do you mean?!”
 Tav: “I can’t. I can’t. I-… It’s not-… I-… Tav doesn’t exist. I made 
her up. That’s not my name.” 
She looked up at him with tears in her eyes. Her final secret now 
revealed. She was terrified that she had ruined his desire to marry, 
but she couldn’t let him marry a lie. Tav was not her. 
Astarion: “Would you like to tell me your name then?”
There was a slight annoyance, but he was more worried than 
anything. He sat her on the table this time as she was easier to reach 
than on the bench. But, Tav shook her head. She didn’t feel ready. 
She needed to breathe to calm herself. 
He led her there as he felt her take deep breaths to steady her pulse. 
She didn’t look at him, she just burried her face in his chest. It took 
her a couple of minutes to calm down. 
The she looked up at him.
 Tav: “I’m ready.”
