Chapter 2 – The offering
 After some days after the water hauling and the help, Halsin called River to a 
meeting back at the Grove. With the new offering of a new place, the people 
had caught quite a stir. They were to go at night to meet. They were to travel 
back by portal and then walk to the Grove. It was not a long walk.
 Astarion: “So then, you go up first and if you don’t come back in about a 
minute then it’s safe.”
 River: “Yes. Also, I think I will find a way to make like a little outhouse on 
the portal outside so it’s safer. I just wish we had a way to tell if the sun is out
 or not. Much easier, you know.”
 He smiled. All the little things she considered for him to stay safe and she 
saw no issue with them. It made him appreciate the effort as well as made 
him try to match her. Now he knew how to place the bedroll like she liked, 
and how got she liked the water. It was surely the little things that showed 
how much they took care of each other. A well-oiled war machine indeed.
 So, they went up and on their way to the Grove, they talked about a lingering 
topic. River felt a little bad that they hadn’t told Halsin all that happened. 
Also, both of them were well aware that Halsin at one point developed 
romantic feelings for ‘Tav’. So, they wanted to take the opportunity to talk 
with Halsin about the recent develpments. River loved Halsin dearly, but not 
as a romantic partner. She saw him more like a brother she never had, but 
needed. He was family. That, and that Astarion doesn’t like to share his 
woman. Both River and Astarion came from complex backgrounds that 
involved not having autonomy over their bodies, so they simply couldn’t be 
as ‘free’ with giving themselves to many, like others would. Otherwise, the 
more the merrier, but sometimes things don’t work out that way. For some 
folks, it can’t be more. They wanted to clear the air and just make peace. 
They were certain that Halsin would understand and accept, but this was 
more about them clearing the air and feeling at peace with the situation. 
Then the arrived at the gate of the Grove. They decided to just climb it rather 
than open the gate. River climbed on Astarion’s back and he climbed up like 
she was weightless. She simply held on tightly because she knew he would 
enjoy the short embrace. They ended up scaring the guards, but quickly 
noticed who they were and allowed passage. 
Then they walked up to where the meeting was to be held. She took his hand 
as they went up their way. Pretty quickly they arrived to the bonfire where 
the rest of the people were. This time there were more Druids present, 
though. River, feeling herself in the presence of royalty from both clans, she 
bowed to both. Astarion rolled his eyes, but followed. He knew that they now
 represented the spawn who were still somewhere at this time.
 Halsin: “Oak Father’s blessings, Tav, Astarion. Welcome back.”
 Zevlor: “Friends, welcome!”
 River: “Good evening and well met, friends. We’re here.”
 Astarion: “Yes, yes. Thank you all for the invitation. So, then let’s get to it. 
The night won’t last forever.”
 Zevlor: “So, we were told of your new idea for us.”
 River: “Well, I thought that it was a better choice than Baldur’s Gate. And 
surely safer, I mean, we’re just down below.
 Halsin: “Perhaps this can be a blessing in disguise. Zevlor, your people can 
make the temple your own, a new settlement and allow for more people to 
join. It surely has the space for more folks to arrive.”
 River: “That is exactly what I was thinking! That! Sorry, let me calm down. 
The thing is that I know tensions have been high with both clans. I know that 
the Druids cannot provide sufficient space for more refugees. I also know 
that the Tieflings need space to grow, too.”
 Halsin: “And I expected nothing less from you.”
 Zevlor: “I agree. But, this won’t be an easy feat.”
 River: “I agree. Nothing ever is. But, we have done more difficult feats and 
have succeeded to the point that we are still here. We can still fight; we can 
still try.”
 Okta: “But if we move in the temple, won’t it be reclaimed by its rightful 
owners?”
 Astarion: “Who might they be? That place has been abandoned for so long 
that even after the goblin invasion there was no one to claim it.”
 River: “That’s true! I mean, the founders have long been dead. We found 
their remains. We’ll put them to rest soon. But in the time we have been 
there, no one has travelled by. Top or bottom.”
 So, they discussed the little details and the big details, too. They were all 
calm and thorough about the logistics of moving the Tieflings over. Secretly, 
both groups were rather glad to be able to move. For the Druids, this mean 
they had their home back and for the Tieflings, this meant finally a home of 
their own and two champions to fight for them to keep it. 
Zovlor: “So, talking to my people, the answer is yes.”
 River: “Really?! I am trully glad.”
 Halsin: “And you are always welcome to stay or visit.”
 River: “I was thinking that since we are so near to each other that it will 
allow us all to cover more ground. Well, I am getting ahead of myself, but I 
am dead serious about taking back the forest. Having the temple inhabited 
will reduce any other invasion.”
 They pretty much agreed to the logic. They also understood that it will 
require a lot of work from all parties. At this time, they were not to move in, 
but they would be sending out scouting parties to get the place ready first.
 Then the meeting ended and the plan was set in motion. They just had to 
figure out a good way to communicate from top to bottom, but over all, 
everything was set. 
Finally, River went to get Halsin to ask him about having a private talk, but 
back at the outpost. The night was almost done and it would be safer to catch 
the first sun underground. He agreed and walked back with them as the folks 
enjoyed the rest of the night, while others went to sleep.
 Once they arrived and took the portal down, River made tea for them both. 
Astarion didn’t need to drink anything, for River had offered herself before 
they had even left for the meeting at the Grove. 
Halsin: “So, this feels like an intervention or you guys are planning 
something. Which is it?”
 River: “Well, in a way, you are correct. There is a lot that has happened just 
in the last week, and at least for me, I feel bad that I haven’t said anything.”
 Astarion: “Much to my annoyance, for sure. But I agree-… to a point.”
 Hasling: “Well, I am now getting worried. Hahaha.”
 River: “I don’t think it’s bad. It’s just I feel bad for not saying anything.”
Astarion: “We got married.”
 River: “We’re married-… by the feet of Selune.”
 She turned to see the statue of Selune. They no longer felt the crackling 
energy they had felt when they first arrived at the temple. But, they also felt 
at peace within the walls of the outpost and temple. It was as if Selune was 
still back, but didn’t have to make her presence obvious. 
River: “Well, let me start from beginning. When we entered the temple, there
 was this crackling energy that was coursing through me and by proxy, it also 
jumped to Astarion.”
 Astarion: “True. I’ve never felt it before. It was-… strange.”
 River: “And the further we went, the stronger it got. It was even getting me 
sick. My stomach was going crazy. Then we arrived here and it became even 
stronger.”
 Halsin: “That is surely interesting given the fact that this temple has be 
abandoned for a very long time. 100 years in fact.”
 River: “Well, it turns out that I have always been a follower of Selune, but I 
didn’t know it. I didn’t know her. I mean, I was never taught about divines or
 anything like that in my birth clan. Then I was kicked out. But, Selune guided
 me in the darkness I was pushed into.”
 Halsin was very interested. It was not common for her to go into details about
 her past to anyone other than Astarion. 
River: “So, being here, there was this energy build up that came over both of 
us. And all the remaining secrets that I carried, could no longer be. I was, in a
 way, forced to reveal my self fully.”
 Halsin: “What do you mean by that?”
River: “Tav is not real. Well, not in the way you think.”
 The look of shock on his face was such that even his mouth was agape. Then 
he looked at Astarion for support. He just gave him a smile and a nod. 
River: “Long ago, when I was wilder, I met an old woman who took a liking 
to me. She told me that I reminded her of her deceased daughter. She had 
been found dead in the river and she never got to know how that came to be. 
The woman, Urith, invited me to her home. I took care of her and there she 
told be so much about her daughter. Tav was her name. Sadly, Urith was on 
her last days in this world, for she died on the fith day of my staying with her.
 But before her death, I promised that I would honor her Tav by claiming her 
name and living for her. I gave myself to let her live through me. I gave her a 
fantastic life.”
 Halsing: “Mm-… that explains why I felt your energy shift. So, I’m guessing 
you let her go?”
 River: “Yes. It was time for Tav to finally rest, and for me to reclaim my true
 name. In my clan, my name carried pain. In my solitude, my name and 
identity were forgotten. But, when I arrived here, I could no longer hide. I 
was forced to be myself again.” 
Astarion: “Imagine my surprise when I asked her to marry me and she said 
no. The nerve of the woman.”
 Halsin: “Hahaha. I can’t imagine she’d say no to you.”
 River: “But I did. I couldn’t accept as someone else. I had to accept as 
myself, even if it was scary for me to reclaim myself. This place, its energy 
forced me to confront my past and accept that it’s over. It’s been a long time 
since that clan, those people tossed me away. Now, I have gained a new 
family and I cannot keep pretending that I am Tav. I’m not. It was me 
honoring a girl that I never met. Honoring a girl that didn’t get to live, but by 
giving her my life, I was starting to lose my own. So, I had to let her rest and 
reclaim my own. Halsin, my name is River of the Storm clan. Trained as a 
soldier when I was a child. A clan of rangers, Gloom Stalkers. But very 
corrupted minds. My ancestors had links to powerful familes here in the 
Underdark. The males were sent here ofter, but females were used for 
breeding.”
 That last part made Halsin’s blood run cold. He was smart enough to connect 
the dots. He looked at Astarion’s stoic face. This was the truth.
 River: “This is why, I never saw you as more than a friend, a brother. 
Astarion and I come from abuse. Our bodies were not our own for a very 
long time. Our nature was corrupted by others who claimed power over us. I 
felt bad that I couldn’t see you as something else, but I don’t have the same 
clean nature you were born into. Neither was Astarion’s. We are broken and 
slowly mending. But, I want you to know that I trully deeply love you and 
care for you. It’s just that I will never trully allow another man other than him
 to touch me. I can’t. And I know that to him, sharing me will be painful. We 
are bound together. We are one. If one goes, so will the other.”
 Halsin: “That is-… I-… In my years, I have never been let down and also 
lifted up at the same time. I am honored that you both care enough about me 
to tell me your painful truth. There is no reason for you to reveal yourself yet 
you have. I thank you. I also care about you both deeply. And it is good to 
know where we all stand. I won’t lie, I am disappointed that I don’t have 
chance, but to know the reasons why, are difficult for me to know and I 
didn’t live through it. Not even when I was capture for 3 years here.”
 River: “I still find it amazing how you weren’t broken, but then again, I was a
 child and Astarion was trapped longer.”
 Halsin: “I supposed I would have also succomed had I not escaped.”
 Astarion: “You sure were lucky then. I am jealous, but had I not been 
trapped, I would have missed out on her.”
 She blushed. She hated to admit it, but she loved it when Astarion told others 
that he wanted her. 
River: “I just don’t want to lose the friendship and family wheve created. 
You know that I will always find a way to stand by your side.”
 Halsin: “So, River, huh? That is something else, isn’t it?”
 Astarion: “Tell me about it. This one is just full of surprises. I won’t lie, but 
I’m sort of worried at times. Hahaha.”
 River: “Well, from my past, that was pretty much it. As for everything else, I 
can’t help but be an open book. I mean, we made lo-…”
 Astarion: “Perhaps we should keep that book to ourselves, darling. I’m sure 
Halsin can figure out what we did.”
 Halsin laughed at this for he did figure out. He could smell how this 
abandoned outpost smelled like pheromones and Underdark mixed into one. 
But the place also felt rather peaceful. 
Halsin: “But, I’m not going to lie. Changing your name now will take time to
 get used to.”
 River: “Don’t worry. I don’t mind being called Tav. You can call me by 
either name.”
 Halsin: “No, no. Tav must be honored, but also laid to rest. You are River 
and also a married woman. But I am glad that you both have each other.”
 Both Astarion and River smiled. They trully felt blessed to be together 
despite all the hardships they had.
 Halsin: “Well then. Do you have anymore secrets that you want to reveal? 
I’m all ears.”
 River: “No, that was all. Thank you for taking the time to listen. I feel better 
that I don’t have to pretend anymore.” 
Halsin stood up and hugged her and then Astarion, much to his displeasure. 
Then they said their good byes. Halsin took the portal back to the top. But 
tonight, they would have another unlikely visitor.
 As they prepared for River to go to sleep, there was a flash of light right were
 the Selune statue was. It was someone they would have never imagined, nor 
expected to ever see. It’ was Aylin. 
River: “What in the hells?! Dame Aylin?”
 Aylin: “I was sent here to see first hand what you are doing.”
 River: “And is there something I must be doing? I am really going blind here.
 Must we leave? Or is there-…”
 Aylin: “Interesting. Last time we met, you didn’t know who you were. But, 
now I see why you were chosen for this task.”
 River: “Chosen? Me? I am nobody. I just vowed to protect my people.”
 Aylin: “Amazing. You aren’t one of them, yet in your heart, your claim lays 
true. And your lover, now, is protected, too. You trully are a worthy 
champion of the outcasts and the forgotten.”
 River: “They deserve to live and thrive. I vowed before Selune to do so. And 
to take care of this place in her honor. I will take care of her lost children for 
as long as I can hold life.”
 Aylin: “And hold life you shall.”
 River felt a burning inside her. A searing pain she had never felt before. She 
fell to her knees clutching her stomach. Astarion ran to her aid.
 Astarion: “What the hell are you doing to her?!” 
Aylin: “You will one day know. For now, keep going. Both are doing what 
you should. Be well.”
 And with a flash, she was gone. River was slowly coming to as Astarion 
helped her up. 
Astarion: “My love. Are you alright?”
 River: “I don’t know. It burned and I couldn’t breathe.”
 She lifted her tunic to see her stomach, but he saw that the mark was gone. 
She touched it and felt nothing. 
River: “It doesn’t burn. I-… What did she do to me? Astarion, I’m scared.”
 Astarion: “Come now, my love. Don’t be. Now, now.”
 They both knew what had happened, but didn’t want to say it out loud in the 
fear that it might wake them from this dream. They knew the divine work in 
ways not always clear. Perhaps it would be possible to one day get the other 
half of the blessing, but for now, River was returned whole.
 He finally let her back to get some rest while she cried silent tears. She was 
unsure of what had just happened and why it had happened. As she slept, she 
had memories of her past as a child come forth as nightmares. She ran from 
her clan, her cousins and uncles. She ran from the wolves. She ran until her 
lungs wanted to burst. She hated running.
 When she came to, Astarion was already up and about. Today he had taken 
the initiative of making her something to eat as well as some tea. He knew 
she had a rough night for she had been restless and her face showed as much.
 Astarion: “Let’s tackle the sectret room today. I belive you said it would be a 
nice bedroom.”
 River: “Yes, please. I would like that. It only needs cleaning now.”
 Astarion: “And the issue with the wall.”
 He made a face. He knew how to track foes and dispatch them in silence, but 
neither were masons or carpenters. They did what they could, but it was 
difficult to figure out things without guidance. 
River cleaned up all the cobwebs from the walls, ceilings, and the floor. 
Astarion moved some items outside the room through the hidden wall which 
was still open. They decided to use three crates and some supplies they had 
found to make a wooden panel to cover the giant hole in the wall which lead 
to the kitchen. Since River now had her pack, they used the tools they had. 
The hatchet was of great use. 
She used the leather straps to create more support while fixing the planks 
together to make the wall. It sort of looked like horizontal blind curtains, but 
it would hold until they hired a mason. The other crates which had been 
emptied were aranged in a way that they served as a bedframe. It woul create 
a buffer between the cold ground and River. She was always unusually hot, 
but it helped if she wasn’t directly on the floor.
 For this one, they used the tarp to cover the wood. Then placed the bedrolls 
on top, and finally the bed pelts they used on their trip here. She also created 
a litle section where they could store their valuable items like the tent. As for 
the toy plushies, they finally got to adorn the new bed. Then she brought over
 a workbench and a stool over to the room to serve as a sort of study space. 
Finally, she put all the books she’d found around on the table. 
Once they finished cleaning and fixing what was to be their main bedroom, 
Astrion tried his luck with thinking how to make a little outhouse looking 
room for the portal outside. He had taken some paper and quill that Tav had 
in her pack. She didn’t mind. She had gotten into the habbit of grabbin almost
 everything she found when exploring. That or buying things that might be 
useful at some point. For example, she had 10 vials of basilisk oil. Did she 
need it? No. But she had it. She had even kept the poison that Nettie had 
given her the first time she visited the Grove. She’d doubled the amount by 
mixing it with oil. It stuck better to the arrow heads that way. 
Since he was busy doing his own thing, she decided to find another thing to 
keep herself busy for today. It was time to read the journals she found around
 this temple and outpost.
 The story of the founders of this land was rather sad, but not surprising. They
 weren’t soldiers. They were likely naive scholars with a dream and no skills 
with a weapon. They stood no chance. But she was getting names. Mynthe, 
Jarrus, and more skeleton remains outside the porticullus. All of them gave 
their life to defend the outpost, but they were outnumbered and undertrained. 
They stood no chance. It had been a massacre. 
Then she finally decided to venture outside the porticullus once more after 
telling Astarion what she was intending. She was to go outside by scaling the 
broken tower while leaving the main entrance closed. Once again, her 
presence did not trigger the statures. She had taken her own journal of 
clippings and notes along with a charcoal stick. Today, she’d get details of 
the location of the bones who would be laid to reast on the Temple’s grounds.
 She wanted to do this before the Tieflings came, like this she’d have a good 
choice of location. A memorial of sorts was her objective.
 Then as she was checking out the remains and other things left around, she 
came across the High Initiate who happened to be Jarrus. His journal 
revealed the most for he was the one who led them to an early grave 100 
years ago. 
More names were added, Norn Remys in the tunnels, Thulk of the Northern 
Wastes was poisoned by arrow, Bree Brekka bested by a drider. All of them 
true novices, but Jarrus wrote them as initiates for they gave their all for 
Selune and her temple in the unluckiest of places. All because of the 
arrogance of one man trying to bring the light of the Moonmaiden to a place 
that needed more than just them. A fool indeed.                                                
Suddendly, there was a bit of an earthquake and River saw how something 
was moving under the earth. There was danger lurking and she had been too 
long in this place. Stupidly, she didn’t brink any weapons with her, but the 
bones scattered and chests offered some aid. She saw a spear about 3 meters 
away from Jarrus and leapt to grab it and ran. She jumped on a barrel and 
climbed a pillar. 
From the ground jumped a giant beast. It burrowed through underground 
tunnels which explained the earthquake earlier. It was dangerous to go back 
to the outpost the way she came. She’d have to lure it into the sight of the 
moon artillery. It was near, but she wasn’t sure how the beast would move. 
River broke part of the spear first and threw it away from her, keeping the 
spear part. The animal moved towards the shaft thrown. As it did, she 
climbed down and ran back to the porticullus. It turned around and went after
 her. She jumped and threw herself into the steps and as she did, it jumped out
 of the ground only to be met by the statues rays. They hit it hard and the thing
 dropped with a thud on the ground. River took the spear she had left and tried
 to stab it for good measure. The metal tip hit with a clang. It’s armor was too 
strong. She tried again through the mouth of the beast. There was a little 
opening, so she pushed hard until she heard a crack. Then she pushed it off 
the cliff. 
Now, with a couple of scrapes on her hands and knees, she dusted herself off 
and climbed up the fallen tower once more. She was thankful that she was 
able to survive it without her own gear, but it would be the last time she’d 
venture without it. 
When she entered, Astarion notice her bloddied tunic and messy look. 
Astarion: “What happened to you? You look a mess!”
 River: “Wait. Let me get Gale. Just listen in. Gale Drekarios. Can you hear 
me? Gale?”
 They heard a cat’s meow answer the call. 
River: “Tara, love? Is Gale around?”
 Gale: “Tav! I’m here. How may I be of service?”
 River: “Do you have any books or information regarding the types of beasts 
we could find in the Underdark? I was just attacked by one. It had very think 
plating, like armor. It was grey in color and it moved by making burrows in 
the ground then leaped to snap at me.”
 Gale: “My, my-… Well, at the top of my head, no. But, give me some time 
and I will check what I have that could help.”
 River: “Thank you, Gale. So, how are you?”
 Gale: “Seriously? You’ve just been attacked and you are now engaging in 
mild chatter? I’m doing pretty well. Tara is, too.”
 River: “Well, I’m glad to hear it. I’m fine, too. Just some minor scrapes when
 I leaped towards the moonlight artillery. It took care of the beast. But, I’ll tell
 you what? I won’t make the mistake of checking out the space without my 
weapons every again. Hehehehe”
 Gale: “I’m glad to hear. And, also where’s Astarion in all this?”
 Astarion: “I’m here Gale. I’m just as surprised as you are. One minute she 
tells me she’s going out and the next she’s calling you. Mad woman, this 
one.”
 River: “I know. I know. I’m sorry. That was on me, but lesson learned. The 
thing is that I didn’t get to this part of my training. I will have to complete it 
on my own-… and with a little help from my friends, of course.”
 Gale: “Well, I’ll help as much as I can. Hopefully, we can see each other 
soon. I could provide a plethora of books about the Underdark.”
 River: “That would be fantastic. I’d love that. I would like to know a bit more
 before we venture in. In the mean time, we have just finished reclaiming the 
Selune Outpost. I’m thinking that the next thing is to provide a safe space for 
the spawn that need refuge.”
 Gale: “Well, that sounds like a noble cause which is very much you.”
 River: “Can’t be helped. Well, Gale, I’ll leave you now. I have to attend to 
these scrapes, I think my knee is bleeding. I’ll wait for your answer. Love 
you both.”
 Gale: “Tara says likewise, as do I, Tav. Talk later.”
Astarion: “So, you were attacked?! Why didn’t you call me?! You could’ve 
been killed!”
 River: “I’m sorry. I went full survival and I climbed the rock thing first. I 
grabbed a spear as I ran. Broke it. Distracted the beast with part of the shaft. 
Then I took off running. I felt the vibration on the ground and figured it was 
about to leap. I got lucky. I reached the statues right on time. I was stupid. It 
won’t happen again. But, at least now I know that this place needs me to be 
hypervigilant.”
 Astarion: “Well, I hope you don’t mess around. I need you alive.”
 He helped her get cleaned up. Her bleeding was minimal and it stopped soon 
enough. She kissed his head as he helped her clean the scrapes. It was 
moments like these that made him appreciate that there was someone who 
still took care of him even when it was his turn. 
River: “Astarion? I am really sorry. I won’t worry you like that again.”
 Astarion: “I believe you.”
 She giggled. And grabbed his chin to kiss him. 
River: “I want to bury the bones up top. Can you help me, please?”
 Astarion: “Of course. But, I think you should go above first. We don’t want 
strange interruptions, anymore.”
 River: “Yes. Let me do that.”
 She got up to go, but stopped and walked back. Gave him an akward smile, 
while he gave her a stern look. Then she went for her weapons. She just 
promised to be more prepared and forgot right after.
She got dressed with light armor and all her gear, then went up. It was 
already night time. The moon was right above, which meant it was still early 
night, so they might be able to do more, perhaps even finish burying the 
bones. So, she headed down. 
By the time she was down, he had gotten the wheelbarrow ready to go.
 Astarion: “Are we doing them separately or all together? It is a lot of bones.”
 River: “I only identified fully one of them, so together. I will make them a 
little plaque later.”
 By now, they had their tools ready. The spade was left in the kitchen ready to
 be taken up. Astarion finally pulled the lever to open the porticullus to make 
it easier to move. He was still a little unsure about the statues, but they did 
nothing to him, either. 
They got all the remains of the people they identifed right outside of the 
outpost. Then went back inside. Astarion helped with gathering the remains 
of the person above the porticullus, too. So, one by one, the founders, the 
initiates of Selune, were collected to be laid to rest in the temple above. 
As they went up, he stayed behind to check the space outside the portal to put
 up the little shelter he had been thinkg about, while River went to the main 
courtyard of the temple to find a good spot for the founders to finally rest. 
Then she saw an area where the moonlight shone bright. 
She walked towards it with her wheelbarrow full of bones. She then put the 
wheelbarrow down and took her spade to begin digging a hole. She had dug a
 little when Astarion asked for the spade so he could help, too. She then began
 to way a little prayer.
 I don’t know any prayers for Selune, but I will do my best for you all. May 
your spirits find their way back from the darkness up to her light. May 
your wrong doings be absolved and your bones finally rest in her grace. 
You weren’t warriors, yet you all faught valiantly. Be at peace. 
As they carefully laid each of the people down in the hole, she was overcome
 with grief and joy. It was sad what happened to them and the reason for it 
even worse, but she was glad that she was the one that got to find them and 
lay them to rest in their beloved temple of their beloved Selune. Now, hers 
too.
 When they finished, she hugged Astarion as they were bathed by the 
moonlight at this funeral of the people who were responsible for the creation 
of the temple. Then they decided to go for a little walk around the temple.
 This time it felt different, no longer the sensation of silent dread lingered in 
the walls of the temple. If anything, you could feel a quiet hum of life just 
waiting to be let out and fill up every corner of this space. 
River: “I think this will be great for the refugees. It is large and has many 
possibilities for adding smaller cottages. What do you thinkg?”
 Astarion: “I’m with you. It’s strange, though. There are a lot of things I never
 imagined being a part of, and now we are at the cusp of the beginning little 
nation of outcast and misfits. Hahaha.”
 River: “The best kind of kin to belong to. I’m home. We’re home. LOOK! A 
lily. Let me give the founders one.”
 She went to take a white lily flower and took it back to the grave and placed 
it on top. 
River: “There. Perfect. I hope they don’t mind. It’s the best I can give them 
for now, but I do it with love.”
 Astarion smiled at her and held out his hand to head back down. It was 
nearing the time for them to seek the shadows again. Their new home.
