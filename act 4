Chapter 4  
To new beginnings  
He hadn’t felt this desire inside him in the longest time. As Cazador’s slave, he had to use his 
body to get victims. He felt nothing, desired nothing. It was disgusting for him to have others
 react to his innate abilities. He hated people that made him feel like a cheap whore. 
But with Tav, it was different. She was not getting anything out of it. She didn’t need his 
protection. He didn’t have anything to his name, so she wasn’t there for power or money. 
Hell, had he chosen ascension, he knows for a fact she would have either left or killed him 
after giving him a head start. Yet, her reaction towards him was always intriguing.  
At times, like a mother looking after her progeny, she made sure all the members of the party 
were well rested and fed. She made sure everyone was taken care off, even the blood-drinker.
 But at other times, she felt like a lover with a desire to take care of the needs of her lover.  
Now, here she was once more, willing to give herself to the monster, to her monster, her 
Astarion.  
He was hungry, but his hunger for her wasn’t just for sustenance. He wanted her, too. His 
Tav. His woman. His lover. His and no one else’s forever. 
Against his better judgment, he let himself enjoy this moment of desire with his more than 
willing participant. It was obvious she was struggling to stay in control of her body, but 
perhaps one more for the road. 
He began to caress her neck with his nose, taking in her sweet scent rich in iron and flowers. 
He noticed that her blood reminded him of spring flowers in a meadow, but lately she had 
been doing different things to ensure her blood was more nutrient rich, for him. 
Her body shivered at his cold touch now that her contrasting heat made him feel like ice. She 
was struggling with her body, her desire. She tried to stifle a moan, but failed. 
“Mm.” 
Her hand quickly went up to her mouth, but wasn’t fast enough. He moved quicker and 
placed his needy lips on hers. Another moan escaped her throat as her hand reached his head 
and began kneading his scalp, grabbing his curls, while her other hand caressed his scar
covered back. 
Her body was losing a battle she knew she would never win. She was letting go of all her 
safeguards. She needed him, her lover, to take charge and make her his once more. Every cell 
in her body was screaming for his touch. He complied. He broke away from her lips 
and began kissing her jaw line, moving slowly down her neck. He passed his tongue over her 
collarbone, her neck. He felt her shiver.  
This was it. She felt it from the pit of her stomach out like a shockwave from her center, out of
 her limbs. Her wetness was felt quickly as he kept kissing slowly down her shoulders, 
breasts.  
He wasn’t in a hurry to remove any clothes, but they were certainly in his way. He desired 
her taste on his lips, his tongue. He went back for another kiss. She moaned again while 
arching her back. Her hands now on his back, became little claws that caressed with 
her aggressive passion. She knew she could break his skin, but she wasn’t trying to. She was 
simply holding on for dear life as he made her climax. He smiled as his lips parter to allow 
his tongue find hers.  
As soon as their tongues caressed, she saw a supernova in her mind’s eye. He felt how a 
surge of energy coursed through her body straight to his and for the first time in forever, he 
moaned along with her, only parting from her lips to allow their initial passion to escape their
 lips. 
That was all he needed to lose his resolve. He needed to claim her. He quickly took off his 
shirt from her body and his own shirt from his. Now, on top of her, he saw her. Her breasts 
craving his touch, his lips on them.  
She saw him with desire, but was still struggling to contain herself. 
“Astarion ...”, she whispered. “Are you sure?”, she gasped. 
“I’ve never been more sure of anything. I need you, Tav. I want you. Let me have you.”, he 
said with such seduction, it made her skin burn once more with passion. 
“I’m yours, Astarion.”, she managed to say before he went in for another kiss. 
He moved her with ease to sit her up, her legs straddling him, with his own now extended 
behind her. Now there was no distance from each other. His cold naked chest was now 
touching her warm chest. He kissed her neck and shoulders, leaving a trail of goose pimples 
on her skin. She kissed his neck and tried to copy his movements clumsily with the little 
experience she had.  
She wanted to pleasure him as much as he was pleasuring her. Even now, she couldn’t help 
herself. Her desire would always demand that he enjoyed every bit as much as she did.  
He smiled as she kissed him, trying to copy his moves. He loved this feeling. It was always 
him who took charge, but this one, this one was trying her best to pleasure him back. He was 
more than willing to allow it. It felt great. 
Then he began to move down her body, slowly kissing her breasts, using his tongue and lips 
to tease her already hard nipples. Tav’s body shivered with desire, not being able to stop her 
shallow breaths and occasional soft moans of pleasure that escaped from her lightly parted 
lips. Astarion was deeply enjoying how his touch was causing such a reaction on her, and he 
was just starting. He wanted more, and he knew she did, too. 
He continued kissing her down her stomach, caressing the sides of her with his cold hands, 
now slightly warmer because of her own heat. And then he arrived at the button of his pants. 
The thought of her wearing his clothes while enjoying her touch drove him mad. It was such 
a sensual sight to see her panting while looking at him with her beautiful round eyes full of 
lust for him. 
He unbuttoned each of the buttons with expert care. And slowly began to pull them down 
her legs, revealing her light bronze skin. He hadn’t had much of a chance to enjoy her beauty 
the first time, but now he was taking all the time in the world. This was his moment to enjoy 
what he felt was rightfully his. This was his Tav. His woman. 
“Astarion ... mm ... you can’t ...”, she tried to say, but her own pleasure escaped her throat.  
“Hush now, my love. Consider this my answer to your request. Yes, now and forever, yes. 
You are mine and I am yours. Now, stop interrupting me.”, he purred with his sweet voice.  
He continued removing the pants and dropped them on the floor. She had been wearing 
nothing but his clothes, so now she lay  bare, trying to keep her legs together, feeling a little 
embarrassed of him seeing her all without filters. 
He grabbed hold of her ankles and began to open her up. “Now, now, lover. Let me enjoy 
every vision of you, my goddess, my queen, my Tav.” 
A moan escaped her throat once more. Her fire inside was too much to contain. She needed 
him, now more than  ever. Her body craved his cold touch to put out the fire it started in her. 
Her back was starting to arch in pleasure from him just watching her writhe in the pleasure 
he caused her. Her hands went to her breasts to play with her hard nipples.  
She finally lost control of her self and gave in to it all. Her right hand moved down her body 
to stop at her folds. She needed to touch herself. Her body screamed for it, she needed her 
fingers to circle around her with vigor. She was on the verge of yet another climax. 
“I said to stop interrupting me, lover.”, he flicked her hand away. 
“Astarion, please! ... mm”, she moaned with delightful pleasure, face pouting. She ached for 
his touch, but he was taking it slow. She wanted him now. 
“If you insist, but I’ll do it my way.”  
He pulled her legs apart and placed her legs on his shoulders for easier reach. He could smell 
her sweet woman smell. He’d never been so close to her like this. It was exhilarating. 
Then he began kissing the inside of her thighs, lightly nipping at them. She buckled, causing 
him to get even closer. He smiled. He took in her smell once more. He could see her wetness 
just building up as he continued to love her. 
He finally reached his first objective. His lips were now on her clitoris. He began to lightly 
suck on it with a kissing motion. Her legs buckled again. He switched to his tongue, moving 
it in circles around her clitoris. Her panting sped up as he increased the force of his tongue. 
Then he moved his tongue a little lower. He wanted to taste her. He wanted to feel her as she 
gasped his name in pleasure. The sweetest his name was ever said. 
“Ah ... mm ... Asta ... mm ... my star ... AH!”, she panted as her climax trapped her in his 
mouth. 
His tongue reached inside her as she climaxed. He moved in, in circles, inside her. She 
reached his curls and grabbed on for dear life. That was it for him, too. He wasn’t expecting 
her to pull him in closer in her passion that she passed on her fire to him. 
“Mm ...”, he couldn’t help but reach his first climax with one of the many he’d given her. His 
knees faltered and went down. He laughed. 
“My, my ... that’s a first.”, he mused as he had never been brought down to his knees.  
This was his first orgasm in memory for  him. He was always the giver, but she now was his. 
His passion for her grew. He desired her even more. He was determined to become one with 
her.  
She panted, her chest heaving. All the while, a content smile formed on her lips, her eyes half 
closed. Her legs relaxed and her back released the tension it had caught. She rode her orgasm 
until her body went limp. She  was done. It was fine if they stopped here. She hand’t noticed 
he too had climaxed along with her. But he did, and he wasn’t done. Not yet.  
He began to crawl his way back to her. He needed to kiss her. He wanted her to taste herself 
on him. This idea was sure to make him climax again, along with her.  
His lips on her lips, his tongue entering and finding hers. He circled her tongue with his to 
ensure she could taste her sweet flavor now on his lips and tongue. Her back arched again. 
Her legs parted. He nestled himself on top of her. He began to hump on her. His member 
hard, throbbing, aching for her to surround him. To choke him. 
His pants were still on, causing the cloth to rub against her, making her legs open more, 
begging him to do what it was meant to do. She demanded he claimed her, to enter her. All 
the while, he ignored her for the time being. He wanted to tease her folds a little longer. He 
needed her to build her fire. He wanted to be consumed by her fire. 
Then he stood up to finally removed his last remaining garment. She looked up at him, 
standing there like a marble sculpture carved by the hands of forgotten gods. He was 
perfection, eternal, ethereal, and hers. 
He saw her face full of awe and desire. He had her right where he wanted her to be, in his 
grasps, begging for more of him. She was intoxicating to him.  
As his pants fell to the ground, his member was now clearly begging his master to let him do 
wha it was made for. It was made to become one with Tav’s womanhood. It demanded to be 
surrounded, choked by her as she enjoyed his friction. Astarion could barely contain himself. 
He also caught her fire of desire.  
He grabbed hold of her ankles and pulled her closer to the edge. He was getting her ready to 
be penetrated by his throbbing member. She gasped and felt how her wetness dripped in 
preparation for his entry. 
“Mm ... Astarion ... my love ... I’m yours. Please ...”, she half moaned, half panted. Her body 
was loosing energy, but her passion still burned strong. She needed him. 
He used his cool hand’s fingers to lightly part her folds. He didn’t want to hurt her as he slid 
inside her. He felt her flinch at his cool, touch. He paused. 
“Is this okay, love?”, he asked, hoping she wouldn’t deny him inside. He burned for her. 
“Yes, please. Astarion, please.!”, she begged him to continue. She had waited long enough. 
His tip was now right at her entrance. Her legs parted as much as they could to receive him. 
He growled as he slid his member, feeling her bumpy skin inside her most confined space, 
made just for him. Her back arched as he slowly slid inside her. Her eyes rolled back while a 
loud moan was heard from both. 
They were finally one in synchronized pleasure. He reached her end. She felt him and 
moaned again while crying his name. 
“Astar ... Mm ... Ah!”, she managed to say before feeling him begin to slide out of her.  
She grabbed on to the sheets in pleasure. His cool member was heating up because of her. 
That made her mad with pleasure. She was sharing her life force with her undead lover. That 
made her tip over the edge. Her walls clenched, pushing him out, but he thrust in harder. It 
will be a battle of wills.  
He began to push harder and faster, her body reacted. Her walls contracted, swollen with 
blood for her passion. Her sensitive area very aware of the man sliding in and out of her with 
forceful passion. He didn’t hurt. He felt pleasurable insider her. She had never had anything 
like this before. Her back arched again. She tried to hold on as he reached her cervix with his 
cool member. In, out, in, out. Faster and faster.  Their breathing got faster and faster. 
They were one, one flesh, one body, one soul. 
He leaned down while staying inside her. Pumping in and out, feeling how her body swelled 
around his member, tried to push him out while he kept trying to say inside her. His mind 
was a swirl of passion. He was losing control of himself again. 
He kissed her with more passion than before. He was starting to lose control inside her, on 
her, with her, for her. He loved her more than life itself at the moment. He was blessed. 
And then, with his sharp fang, she nicked her tongue. Blood came rushing out of the small 
cut. That was it. He was gone. 
He pulled his face to her neck and bit down. As his mouth filled with her blood full of her 
passion, he thrusted harder, faster. 
He fed as he enjoyed the pleasure of her walls crashing around him. As his ears enjoyed the 
sweet cry of her moans and panting breath. He knew her eyes were white in the throbbing 
passion he was causing her. This made him thrust ever harder, faster. 
Her hands reached his head, her fingers curling around his curls. She felt how her body ached
 in her biggest orgasm yet. She was trembling from her arms to her legs down to her toes. She 
was exploding and imploding all at once. She couldn’t let go of his hair, but in her passion, 
she grabbed his head closer to her neck. Her legs buckled and surrounded his waist. She 
straddled him while laying on her back. His body on top of hers. Her nipples and breasts 
rubbing on his cool skin. Their stomachs becoming one. Her sweat causing the only wetness 
on their skin. Her skin marking her scent on her lover. Every inch of him was covered in her 
claim.  
He knew he had to reclaim his will lest he bleed her dry, but just a little longer. He felt a new 
sensation. He never felt that before, but it was exhilarating. As he thrusted inside her with a 
passion he hadn’t had in the thousands of conquests of his past, he felt in his groin a 
pulsation. A small pain that was waiting to be released.  
He kept thrusting in and out, faster and faster. Feeling her body trapped in wave after wave 
of an eternal orgasm. He gave her this passion, and he was riding it for dear life right along 
with her.  
Then, he felt a release. That little pain he had begun to feel was nothing more than the natural
 explosion any man could have when their passion had nowhere else to go, but out, into her.  
He felt this new sensation. Something from inside him clearly came out, but he was too busy 
to pay attention. He stopped feeding on her. Now it was him whose back arched. A strong 
groan escaped his throat as his hips buckled trying to push inside her further, just a little 
more. His member throbbed and released inside her with force.  
“Ah, Tav, my love, ah!” 
No words could escape her now. She was too far gone for her body to match his scream. She 
could only feel that something had escaped him. It burned a little, but it didn’t hurt. It felt so 
good. How his scream was suffocated next to her ear. How her hands were forcefully 
grabbing his curls. How his throbbing member had just released inside her. How that 
burning release was coming out of her and down her.  
She moaned loudly. He caught it in his mouth. He kissed her once more as her final orgasm 
wave left her body limp and content. His body, too, went limp after releasing itself inside her.
 Both panting in joy for all the sexual tension that had been building up for months, finally 
was able to culminate inside each other.  
She looked at his eyes with love and contentment. She was in full bliss. He smiled back at her,
 his expression matching hers. He was both shocked and exhilarated at what had just 
happened. He wasn’t sure if she had noticed how his body had been able to ejaculate. He 
thought it was impossible, since he’d never done that in 200 years of servitude or 
enslavement. 
“Tav, my love, did you... did I just ...?”, he tried to ask, feeling a little embarrassed and 
vulnerable. 
“Mm ... Yes. I felt it inside me. It stung a little, but it mostly sent me over the edge. Then I felt 
how it flowed out of me and down my ...”, she stopped, feeling her cheeks flush.  
“Oh, that’s new. I didn’t imagine it were possible for us to ... Can I ...?”, he motioned to her. 
He was curious and wanted to see it. She bit her lip nervously and agreed for him to go down
 and see, taste, feel. She had already allowed him to taste her, it was only fair he could check 
what he left inside and around her.  
He parted her legs once more. Seeing how her hair was now a little more matted with her 
sweat and his cum. 
He leaned in to see closer. Her scent was mingled with his. He could smell his vampire 
venom mingled with her own sweat and cum. It smelled intoxicatingly delicious to him. It 
was true, though. It had come out, for he could still see some of it pooled inside her entrance, 
while a trail of it had run down and landed on the mattress.  
He couldn’t help himself. He had to taste it. He leaned in closer, parted his lips and with his 
cool tongue, he stuck it right at her entrance and began to clean her. Indeed, it tasted like his 
venom, but it was thicker than his saliva. Though now there were also other flavors coming 
from her. He liked the difference between her normal relaxed state to this state where her 
hormones ran havoc on her blood. He could taste a strong difference in her blood. He then 
apologized for he was about to do something he shouldn’t. 
“I’m so sorry, Tav, but it can’t be helped. You’re just too much to pass up.”, he said without 
looking up. And he bit her inner thigh. Drawing blood while he took a deep breath, taking in 
that mixed scent of his passion and hers. Then he bit the other side. Letting her blood run 
down his throat while he was still intoxicated with their combined scent. This was too much, 
even for him, but he couldn’t stop. He needed to consume her.  
Then he let go, o only to go back to find her clitoris. He suckled it for a moment, then slid his 
tongue inside her once more. He was on a mission to not waste his venom on the mattress. It 
was his to enjoy, and he was going to take advantage now.  
All Tav could do was let out one loud pleasure moan before she lost consciousness. Her body 
was done. She not only given him her blood, but she gave him all of her. She wanted to be 
possessed, consumed, and he did just that. There was nothing left for her to give; he had 
taken all and more.  
She was fast asleep, her body wet with sweat, between her legs his venom, his saliva, her own
 cum. She was sticky and smelled strongly of his scent. But on her face, there was a light smile.
 Her soul finally took hold of his and became intertwined. Her ritual was done. He was hers 
and no one could break this bond. 
He finally let her legs go. Licking his lips, with a coy smile, he positioned himself next to his 
sleeping Tav. He spooned her and placed his head on the pillow. He didn’t need sleep, but 
wanted to stay there in silence as she slept. He took everything she was willing to give him 
and a little more.  
He was feeling a strong sense of peace and joy. This woman came out of nowhere and not 
only took care of him, but helped him destroy his demons. And now, this. How in the hells 
was she able to let him ejaculate! That wasn’t supposed to be possible, yet here we were.  
He allowed his thoughts to settle while he hugged her sleeping body. And another first in a 
very long time. He didn’t enter a trance, he fell asleep while holding his Tav.
