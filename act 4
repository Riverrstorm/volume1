Chapter 5  
Let’s head out. Let’s find out.  
There was a knock at the door. Someone outside wiggled the door knob and it turned. They 
opened the door and saw two naked bodies, embraced, legs intertwined, bodies asleep.  
“Oh, dear! I’m sorry. I thought the room was empty.”, said the maid, her face flushed red 
with embarrassment.  
Astarion took notice first, and he opened his eyes looking in the direction of the woman at the
 door. Some onlookers behind her trying to peep at the scene inside the room. 
Tav began to stir, and then her eyes popped open in a panic.  
She jumped out the bed, her naked frame now visible to all who managed to see her. The 
maid flushed even more crimson now.  
“I’m terribly sorry, Miss.”, still shaken, for she knew the naked man was a vampire and his 
lover was not. 
“Close the damn door, woman! You’ve seen enough. Well, get dressed and be on our way!”, 
Astarion said with loud annoyance.  
He wasn’t happy that his sleep had been interrupted, along with the fact that some onlookers 
got a glimpse of a very nude yet very disoriented Tav. 
Tav finally reacted and reached for something to cover herself while letting a giggle escape. 
“Close the door, Miss! Please!”, she shouted while she laughed.  
Finally, the maid was able to get her bearings and shut the door, her face still crimson. She 
would likely never forget these two naked bodies embraced while sleeping. She hadn’t 
imagined the faces of the ones who had provided a show hours before with their passionate 
moans, name screaming, and loud bed thumping. That was the reason for the onlookers. 
They wanted to see the lucky man who had made the songbird sing with such passion.  
They were about to become a legend at that inn and give the brothel a run for its money, 
according to some.  
Tav walked towards the window to check on the light outside. It was dark out. They had to 
head out now and find the next shelter before sun up. She turned around and saw Astarion 
had also stood up from the bed, his body  clearly more relaxed now.  
“I think we need to head out now. What do you think?”, she asked in a soft voice.  
Slightly more alert than her, “I agree. Let's pass on the bath. Let’s just get dressed, pack up 
and go.”  
He was clearly hoping to let his scent linger longer on her skin, as well as let hers linger on 
his. This was a naughty thought he had, but wouldn’t dare admit it to her. She was still too 
groggy and lost in her thoughts to notice. 
They quickly moved back and forth, getting their belongings in their respective packs. He got 
dressed and so did she. This time, she wore her own clothes. A pair of leather pants that 
hugged her figure, a blouse that was also hugging her curves, and a corset that pushed her 
breast out enough to make any man’s eyes not be able to look away.  
He wore the clothes she had worn earlier. He smiled, knowing that all he was doing now was
 extending the night of passion they had earlier.  
She put on her pack and he did his. She opened the door and was surprised to see a couple of 
folks waiting to see the faces that belonged to the noise from earlier. They were taken aback 
when, past the lovely young woman half-elf, they saw a tall, muscular, marble statue with 
white curls and red eyes.  
Astarion knew what they were thinking, and he relished in the  knowledge that he 
unknowingly gave these worms a show. That and that his woman would be for his very own 
and no one else. He smiled at the g gawkers, flashing his fangs a little too much. 
Tav pushed pass them. “Excuse me. Coming through.”  
She felt many eyes on her, and she began to feel embarrassed. She decided to look at the floor 
instead. Astarion, was more defiant and looked them in the eyes. He was gloating. He liked 
this feeling of people’s shocked expressions. 
They walked down the stairs up to the counter. Tav locked eyes with the maid who had 
woken the up. She was still embarrassed about finding them in their naked embrace. 
“I apologize, again, Miss. I thought you had gone.”, she flustered. 
“It’s fine. Don’t worry about it. It was about time we left. Can you tell me what we owe you 
for the room?”, Tav asked the shop-keeper. He shooed the maid away and took over the 
conversation.  
“Well, you’ve paid 10 gold for the earlier hours, food, and lodging. You stayed another 5 
hours, too. And you both certainly offered a show that boosted my business. We didn’t see 
anything, but we sure heard it,  even down here in the noise.”, he laughed while making his 
annotations on his business ledger. 
“Would you be interested in anything else before I ring you up”, he asked. 
“Well, have you got loaves of bread to spare? Perhaps drink?”, Tav asked, trying her best not 
to look embarresed. 
“Yes, would 2 of each be good for you?” 
“That sounds perfect. Thank you, Sir.” 
He handed her the food and sneaked a bit of dried meat and cheese in the pack. He felt 
obliged to the gift, for he was going to use this odd encounter to market the room as the “love
 suite” for others to enjoy the magic left behind by these two.  
Tav didn’t notice the extras, she just paid and took the pack with a smile. She handed the 
things to Astarion, so he could place her food in her pack. He gave the shopkeeper a knowing
 smile and placed the food in her pack. 
“Tav, dear. I will carry the drink. Your pack is heavy enough.”, he mused. 
“Oh, then let me ...”, Tav tried to take the remaining pack, but he was already placing the 
bottles in his own pack. 
“There we are. No, need my love. It’s done. Let’s go. Let’s head out.” 
Tav turned around, bowed in gratitude to the shopkeeper and the maid then turned around 
and quickly ran to catch up to Astartion who was already walking out the Inn. 
“Astarion! Wait, you walk too fast!”, she said while moving quickly to catch up.  
“Astarion and Tav ... even their names are uncommon. Do you think they are divine, dad?”, 
asked the maid, mostly to herself while looking at those two beings that made an impression 
on her. 
“Well, I don’t know about divine, but I am amazed that a vampire and an elf rented a room, 
gave us a show, paid in full, left a tip, and we all survived to tell the tale.”, said the man.  
He surely wasn’t going to forget this anytime soon. After all, it wasn’t everyday you 
encountered a vampire and lived to tell the tale.  
*** 
I wonder what he’s thinking now. My legs still feel a little sore and so does ... I should have 
asked Gale for a time telling device to know how close we are to sun up or sun down. Oh, 
well, let’s see what I find in the books once we set up camp. 
Tav was lost in her thoughts, not trying to focus on the love making she just had with her 
man, her lover, her Star. But her Star wasn’t so lucky. He couldn’t think of much else. 
That was amazing! How can she be walking still? How much strength is she hiding from me? 
She’s too much, but she’s mine. Focus, we need to find a place to make camp where I don’t 
burst into flames. Mm, I already miss not having to worry about the sun. 
They were a little lost in their own thoughts, but blissfully aware that they had shifted their 
relationship. They finally accepted their feelings for each other and solidified their devotion, 
their connection to each other.  There was a lot of work ahead of them, but they were going to 
do it together.  
“Astarion, have you got any idea how much time we’ve got left before the sun comes up 
again?”, she asked with a wondering tone while a little winded. She was still tired. 
“Huh? ... Yes. See the color of the sky? That’s how you can tell. Once it begins to turn purple, 
we’ve got minutes to find shelter. Once we start to see specks of orange, it becomes 
dangerously close.”, he said, trying to pick up the pace.  
“Oh, that’s logical. Okay, keep looking up and checking the colors. I’ll do that. I’m just so 
nervous about being out and not catching it on time.”, she admitted more to herself than to 
him. 
“You never cease to amaze me. Even now, you still have energy to take care of me.”, he 
stopped walking, causing her to crash into him lightly.  
Astarion turned around and hugged her tightly. She was taken aback but enjoyed this 
moment of intimacy. She looked up at him and smiled. He looked down and smiled back. 
Then he gave her a quick kiss on her lips and then her forehead. He then let her go. 
“Thank you for being you, my love. I never knew how much I needed this in my life until you
 came along, clumsily along that dirt road.”, he mused. 
She gave him a warm smile back. She was glad he finally understood that she was genuine 
about her offer. She was going with him wherever that may be.  
Then she caught a glimpse of her next objective. Giant paw prints. They were nearing their 
first forest. She pulled at his sleeve to get his attention and pointed towards the prints on the 
ground. He took notice and agreed with his head. Neither spoke, for they didn’t want to 
spook the prey.  
He quietly removed his pack and set it down on the ground. She took it and began to move 
towards some trees that offered even more darkness. As she did that, he took off  quickly to 
find that bear that would top off his hunger. He had to get his fill if they were to catch up to 
the seven thousand. 
Where are you, my snack? I can smell you. I can hear you. There you are! 
Astarion pounced like a mountain lion towards the giant male bear that had just become 
aware of this dangerous being with red eyes. 
The bear swatted at him, but Astartion was stronger, faster. He was able to move quickly 
towards the proper vein to get his fill. He bit down and felt how the blood ran down his 
throat until it became a trickle. It was not as great as Tav’s, but it would fill him up.  
Besides, Tav could offer little feeding sessions to keep him full for longer now that he had the 
bear.  
He felt so giddy and drunk now that he had his proper fill. If they weren’t in such a hurry for 
shelter, he swore he could make love to Tav once more and with more passion than before, 
enough to make the stars themselves blush. 
Meanwhile, Tav felt Astarion walk back towards her. She felt relief, though it was silly. A 
bear was no match for her man, but she couldn’t help but feel worried about him being hurt.  
She flashed a giant smile as soon as she saw him. He smiled  back, feeling ecstatic about these 
new emotions that he now carried. 
“Feeling better, my love?” 
“I ... Yes. I needed to top off. It’s not as delicious as you, but it will do for a couple of days.” 
“If you feel peckish, let me know. I don’t want you to go hungry for no reason.” 
“I swear woman. You know what to say and when to say it, and it only to makes you more 
desirable, but I can’t make love to you again right now. We need to find our next camp.”, he 
teased her.  
She flushed red. 
They were both in a fantastic mood, despite feeling a little tired still. They had consumed all 
the energy they had while making love and then were abruptly awoken by a stranger. But, 
they were cheery enough to not let it bother them.  
As they kept walking, Tav felt daring enough to grab Astarion’s hand. He was surprised by 
this, but allowed it, for it also made him happy, and it allowed him to really gage her current 
speed. After all, her stride wasn’t too long, and he was certain her lower half was still a little 
sore. He smiled at the thought. 
Then, they started to see the colors change in the sky, but by that time, they had seen a little 
cave near a lake. This would have to hold them up for the next 12 hours or so of sunlight.  
Great! This is perfect. We can set up camp here and perhaps find game if Astarion needs 
more food, which I doubt, but still. He might have already noticed it, too. 
“Tav, dear. Let’s go and check that cave. This will be our camp for today.” 
“Yes, I’m on it. If we’re lucky, it won’t smell of bear piss or anything of the sort.”  
They both approached the entrance and took a whiff. So far, it seemed clean enough. Tav 
looked around and found a thick dry branch and took it. She had been working her spell 
casting with the help of Gale before, so she was confident she could light up the branch to see 
better in the cave’s darkness. 
“Can you see anything that we should worry about, Astarion?” 
“I got nothing dangerous before or after your branch. I think we did well with this cave.” 
Should I ask him if we can stay in his tent or mine instead of setting up both? I’m too tired to 
set up two of them right now. I promise, I’ll behave. I just don’t want to put up both. 
“If I know you well enough, I’d dare say you’ve got something on your mind. Come on. Spit 
it out.”, he said, while trying to hide a smile. 
She pouted a bit and turned around, pretending to be looking for something in his pack. She 
wasn’t fooling anyone. She got caught in her thoughts and flushed.  
“Come on, now. Out with it. You are a giant red sausage right now, trying to hide while 
looking through my pack.”, he laughed. 
“Oh, well! Fine! I was just wondering if you thought it was a good idea that, well...” 
“Woman, out with it. How can you be so embarrassed right now when I have just made love 
to you. I saw all of you. I tasted all of you and now a simple question is too much.”, he rolled 
his eyes in slight annoyance, but he was right.  
They became one flesh and soul in a tavern with many strangers hearing her pleasure cries, 
and now she was embarrassed to admit she wanted to stay in his tent. 
“Oh fine! I’m getting used to the idea. I wasn’t expecting you to make me yours that way, 
anyway. Let’s just set up your tent tonight and stay together. I feel too tired to set up mine. 
There, are you happy now?”, she said, a little exasperated with him, but also a little defiant.  
She was not willing to take ‘no’ for an answer now that she had been pushed. 
“Oh, that was it. It’s a fantastic idea. Never will I  ever let you sleep alone as long as I’m 
around, lover.” 
She gave him a wide smile, and he was compelled to give her one, too. Even more than that, 
he picked her up and kissed her. Her hands automatically went up to grab his curls in her 
fingers. She seemed to really enjoy doing that every chance she got.  
“Now, now. Let’s not get carried away, too quickly. We still need to set up shop.” 
He put her down and the began putting up his tent, but now a mix of items was evident. 
Some of his things with some of hers. As for the bed, they both decided hers was best as it 
was off the ground, and he had none. 
She cast some warding spells at the furthest end of the cave and at the entrance. While she 
took care of that, Astarion quickly grabbed some branches and rocks to create a camp fire at 
the entrance of the cave. Though, she could come and go as she pleased, he would be stuck 
inside, and he’d rather have a campfire out of habit.  
And just like that, they had a sort of ‘home sweet home’ inside that cave. But just for good 
measure, Tav cast some extra spells to keep intruders out.  
“I know it’s over kill, but I’m exhausted and I’d like to sleep without having another woman 
seeing me naked.” 
Astarion laughed and let her go on with her spells. He never thought of her as a mage, what 
with being a ranger, but he liked the idea of her being able to do multiple things.  
“So, I’m guessing round two is out of the question?”, he teased, knowing well that he also 
needed the rest. 
“You guessed correctly. Have a cookie. I haven’t even bathed. I must smell musky and 
sweaty, but I’m too tired to care. You’ll just have to put with me and my funk for a couple 
more hours. Sorry.”, she said playfully as she began to set up the bed with blankets and pelts.
 She was already feeling her eyelids become lead weights and was yawning more frequently. 
Her tiredness which she had been running from finally caught up with her. She was not 
going to fight it any longer. Astarion just looked at her with loving eyes and smiled, not 
bothering to continue the conversation. 
If she only knew that right now I find her to be the sexiest, most delicious smelling being in a 
100 km radius. I want her to stay smelling musky and feel sticky a little longer, for it is my 
scent that covers her now. She smells like a vampire, and that will keep her safer in this cave. 
He sat in front of the fire as he saw how the light began to cover the trees and hills. He felt a 
sort of nostalgia for no longer being allowed to walk in the sun, but if giving up the sun 
meant he could have Tav, then the sun would not be missed. 
He began flicking rocks at the entrance of the cave while sitting near the fire, all the while 
listening for Tav’s breathing. He wanted to make sure she fell asleep first before joining her. 
He was sure she would fuss over his comfort if he joined her now, and she needed to sleep. 
It didn’t take long before her breathing slowed down and an occasional light snore escaped 
her lips. He smiled. It was time. He looked around one more time, making sure nothing 
dangerous was nearby, and indeed nothing was. He then walked towards the tent, opened 
the flap and stepped in. 
He closed it behind him as he walked through. It looked the same as always, but on the right, 
now, was a makeshift bed with blankets and pelts and on it there was the most beautiful 
woman he’s ever seen. 
She wore one of his shirts, but only the bottom three buttons were done correctly. It was too 
large on her, so it looked more like a small night gown on her small frame. Her thick legs laid 
bare, with her buttocks barely covered by his shirt. It made it look rounder than it was.  
Her hands and arms escaping the long sleeves of the shirt lay extended to the side, and he 
saw something, a paper, in her left hand. He took it and opened it up. 
He saw himself staring at a man with white short hair in curls. He had a very penetrating 
stare with red eyes. His strong cheekbones and masculine jawline, made him think that it was
 a very handsome man. He had thin lips and a coy smile. It was clear that many adjustments 
had been done to the drawing, but it was coming along. It looked more like a portrait rather 
than a child’s drawing. 
Then he saw the signature and date. It was Tav’s drawing of him. He remembered the 
conversation they had once where he wished he could see himself, and here he was doing 
almost that. He didn’t think it was more possible to feel this strong love and connection with 
this woman he had met a little over a year ago. Now he couldn’t contain the love and 
adoration he felt for her. She always managed to say the right thing, or do the right thing at 
the right time. Indeed, as she said, she’s always known, and here was proof yet again. 
He took her charcoal and book and placed the drawing back. It was obvious this was a 
surprise for him, but it wasn’t ready. He smiled, got undressed, and laid next to her. He was 
not hoping to entice her, but he figured their level of intimacy was such that he could sleep as
 he’d like without it being an issue. After all, she was wearing nothing but his shirt 
and sleeping in his tent.  
He didn’t fall asleep at first. He went into trance, replaying and reanalyzing a lot of the events 
that had come to  pass. But he noticed that his breathing was slowing down to match 
hers. Then, when he least expected, he fell asleep once more. They were tired, and their bodies 
agreed to rest together, at least for today.
