CHAPTER 8
 AN INTERLUDE
 They sat there in silence for what felt eons just in silence after their kiss. He looked into her 
eyes and she into his. Just present. Silence. Her breathing. Her heart beating. Intimate. 
Neither knew how to continue. He exhaled, though he didn’t need to, and that was enough to
 break the spell of silence that had covered them. 
“My love, let me step outside and make a fire.”, he kissed her forehead and headed outside.  
He had a lot of thoughts running through his head and need to settle them before attempting 
to say anything else to her. So, he walked as she watched him leave the tent. She needed him 
to step outside, too.  
She poured her heart out in the arms of someone who she felt was safe, a vampire spawn. The
 irony was not lost on her. But, now she needed some time to gather herself, before she could 
face him again. She was afraid this had been too much, even for him, and she wanted him to 
feel safe around her again. Sometimes, when you pour your heart out to someone, they might
 not know how to respond and remain silent. 
As she stayed in the tent with her thoughts, Astarion was outside under the shadow of the 
base of the hill they camped at and the thick canopy of trees. He was safe to move around 
here and that’s what he was looking for. . . That, and wood. 
Should I say something? But what can I say? I can barely deal with my own sorrows and 
woes, and she’s helped me at least by just listening and never pushing? Can I do that for her? 
Have I been doing that? I’m at a loss, here. 
As he was collecting some branches as well as his thoughts, something caught his attention. 
He heard music. 
 “What in the hells?! Music, here?,” he said to no one while he headed towards the melody he 
heard. As he moved towards it, he realized he was chasing the echo of the music he heard. He
 headed back to camp and realized that this was the source of the music. It was Tav. 
 She was still inside the tent with the tent flap open. Her music, her song, flowed out into the 
heavens asking for strength or perhaps thanking for the strength already given. He continued
 to work on making a fire, for he didn’t dare interrupt her. He wanted to listen as he felt it 
calmed his heart and mind.  
 Meanwhile, she had procured her lyre, which she had found in one of the many ruins 
they’ve explored. She hadn’t played much since the worms, but her heart told her it was time 
to sing. This time Tav was certain Astarion was far enough away, she could do it without 
feeling embarrassed. She felt she had already demanded too much from him. If she could 
only gather the courage to sing to him directly. 
She began to play, letting her heart take the lead. 
Let’s get old together. 
Let’s be unhappy forever. 
‘Cause there’s no one else in this world 
That I’d rather be unhappy with 
Let’s be exposed and unprotected 
Let’s see one another 
When we’re weak 
Let’s go our separate ways 
In the night like two moths 
But know that you’re flying home me 
As he finally arrived to the camp, he proceeded to set up the fire by arranging some rocks and
 placing the wood. As he did so, he just listened to her sing about love. Perhaps about him, 
even. He didn’t want to be so bold as to claim that, but he really heard her. He realized just 
how much and how deeply she feels about him. He matters.  
I was born thinking it would all be dreamy 
But I know that I wouldn’t be happy that way 
You wear me out with frustration and heartache and anger 
But we wait for the wave just to wash it away 
Don’t say nothing 
Just sit next to me 
Don’t say nothing 
Just be, just be, just be, just be  
Astarion completed setting up the fire and sat down next to it. His face revealing his 
conflicted emotions, not about Tav, but about everything. He started to realize that he had 
never stopped. One day he was a magistrate in Baldur’s Gate and the next thing he knew, a 
gang of Gur attacked him. He was robbed of his humanity, likely for coin. Then his hell 
began. A tear rolled down his cold cheek. For a long time, he felt his heart needed to cry. 
Let’s let go together 
Let us unfold one another 
And watch all the little things 
that once drew me to you 
Eventually get on my nerves 
I wear you out with frustration and heartache and anger 
But we wait for the wave just to wash it away  
He wanted to shout, to break things. He wanted to fight with the universe for forcing such 
trials on him without his consent. Here they were, two broken people, but not by their own 
doing. They were simply trying to mend the broken pieces of themselves, together. And it 
was extremely hard. He felt hollow about life, but he wanted to feel alive. And he knew it 
wouldn’t be easy for either of them, but he wanted to try, not for her, but for himself. He 
loved her deeply and wanted to mend to give himself fully to her. He wanted to live. 
Don’t say nothing 
Just sit next to me 
Don’t say nothing 
Just be, Just be, Just be 
When you’re sick of the everyday 
When you’re tired of my voice 
When you tell me you’ll walk out that door 
That’s when I know 
that’ll you’ll stay 
He wanted to answer her call. It was building up inside him. His desire to show her that he’s 
there now with her, for her. In his chest a growing longing and sadness that had been his 
longest companion was clawing it’s way out of him while the happiness he felt for finally 
having someone on his corner was fighting its way inside. He felt this battle down to his core.
 Don’t say nothing 
Just sit next to me 
Don’t say nothing 
Just be, Just be, Just be 
Just don’t say nothing 
Just sit next to me 
Don’t say nothing 
Just be, Just be 
Don’t say nothing 
Astarion stood up, determined to answer her call. He almost marched in the tent, startling 
her. She was still sitting on the bed, but now she had the lyre in her hands and red, puffy eyes
 from crying. He went over his things as she watched him with curiosity. Then he found it, his
violin. His chest felt heavy with all the emotions he had been trying to suppress, and was 
finally ready to let to. He tuned it and he began to play. He let his heart answer her call. 
He began to play for her, pouring his heart out as he felt how his soul finally began to break 
into pieces for it was time for it to reshape itself into something better, something new, 
something his. She joined his melody as his began. 
If not for you 
Babe, I couldn’t find the door 
Couldn’t even see the floor 
I’d be sad and blue 
If not for you 
If not for you 
Babe, I’d lay awake all night 
Wait for the morning light to shine through 
But it would not be new 
If not for you 
As he would play, she would she’d complement his melody. She felt his love flow through her.
 If not for you
 Babe, I couldn’t find the door
 Couldn’t even see the floor
 I’d be sad and blue
 If not for you
 If not for you
 Babe, I’d lay awake all night
 Wait for the morning light to shine through
 But it would no be new
 If not for you
If not for you
 My sky would
 Rain would gather, too
 Without your love I’d be nowher at all
 I’d be lost if not for you
 And you know it’s true
 If not for you my sky would fall
 Rain would gather too
 Without your love I’d be nowhere at all
 Oh! What would I do if not for you?
 If not for you winter would have no spring
 Couldn’t hear the robin sing
 I just would have a clue
 Anyway, it wouldn’t ring true
 If not for you
 He ended his song and sat down on the floor looking up at her with a soft smile. She smiled back and 
got the courage to sing to him one more song. So she bagan. This time it was him who decided to 
accompany her melody as she sang.
 They say there is a war
 Between the man and the woman
 I’ve never felt like this before
 My heart knew tthat I couldn’t
 And then you take me in
 And everything beings to feel like I belong
 Like everybody needs a home
 And when I take your hand
 Like the world has never held a man
 I know I cannot heal the hurt
But I will hold you here forever
 If I can
 If I can
 As she said this, his tears began to roll down his cheeks, matching him, she was crying, too, but 
continued her song. He closed his eyes to focus on her words.
 And then I learned the truth
 How everything good in life
 seems to lead back to you
 And every single time time I run into your arms
 I feel like I exist for love
 Like I exist for love
 Only for love
 I can’t imagine how
 it is forbidden from loving
 His eyes opened as she said this. He smiled.
 ‘Cause when you walked into my life
 I could feel my life begin
 Like I was torn apart
 the minute I was only born
 And you’re the other half
 The only thing that makes me whole
 I know it sounds like a lot
 But you really need to know
 We are learning out for love
 And we will learn for love forever
 I know I love you so
 And then I learned the truth
How everything good in life
 seems to lead back to you
 And every single time I run into your arms
 I feel like I exist for love
 Only love
 She kept singing feeling her heart starting to feel lighter and hoped he did, too.
 And when you say my name
 Like white horses on the waves
 I think it feels the same
 As an ocean in my veins
 And you’ll be diving in
 Like nothing is out of place
 And we exist for love
 Only for love
 And I love you
 I love you
 I love you
 As she was ending her song, he put his violin down and stood up. Shakily, he moved towars 
her and helped her up. He placed her lyre on the bed next to his violin. And hugged her. 
And I love you
 I love you
 I love you
 As they embraced, she cradled her head on his neck and she cried. Though she felt lighter, 
there was one thing more that she wanted to let go of. 
“There’s one more thing that I have to tell you. I can’t. . .”
“Are you sure, love?”
 “Yes, the thing is. . . back at the palace, I was. . . I didn’t want to interfere in your choice, but I 
was ready to not. . . to not let you become him. I was ready to kill you.”
 “I know, my love.”
 “But, you don’t understand! I was going to set you ablaze and I along with you. I. . . I don’t 
want to live without you, but I don’t want to let you be a worse monster than. . . Cazador.”
 She hated how that name felt bitter on ther tongue. 
“I know. It was very tempting to take that power all to myself. . . and I. . . I wanted it. I 
wanted to have it all, and have it with you. But, I saw the pain in your eyes. I understood then
 that I had to choose. I had to choose between what I coveted or a woman that had showed me
 trust. Trust! Of all things! I gave you little to earn your trust. I used you. . . I used you for my 
own benefit, and you saw beyond it. You looked passed it. I don’t hold any grudges about it. 
I understand now that you would rather end us than allow me the freedom to become a 
monster I wanted to be.”
 “Oh, my Star, I just. . . I have felt so horrible about it. What if. . .? What if you had. . .?”
 “Yes, but I didn’t. And you didn’t. And if you want, I forgive you. I forgive you, my love. I 
understand where you were coming from. Now, I understand where you are coming from, so
 I get it. And I thank you. I think your plan was the best if I had. . . if I had chosed to kill my 
family, my kind, but I didn’t. And, I didn’t do it for  you.”
 She shifted to look at him and smiled. Her face puffy from craying so much, but for now, she 
let go of so much that she felt she needed him to know.
 “I did it for myself. I wanted to be free of the monster who made me, but to become him and 
have his power was very tempting, I’m not going to lie. But, I’d like to belive I made the right 
choice.”
“I think you did. They didn’t deserve what was done to them, to you. You were all victims of 
a sickness that was forced on you. You did what you could to survive and they’ll have to 
learn to do the same.”
 They let go. And walked toward the bed to lay down. She put her head on his shoulder and 
took his hand. He got comfortable and touched his leg with hers. They just stayed there and 
their world stopped for right now. Bodies tired, heart ligheter, and mind full of everything 
that had just happened. They just lay there in silence for now. Then they closed their eyes and
 rested.
