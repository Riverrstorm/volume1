Chapter 6  
The long winding road  
They remained still for hours as animals walked by, peering into the entrance of the cave but 
not bothering to come in. Clearly the low magic casting had worked, thus allowing them to 
get the proper rest they needed. 
Astarion began to come back first. He finally felt refreshed and rested, despite requiring a 
bath. A smile seemed to be permanently fixed on his face now, and the reason was lying next 
to him. 
Look at you, beloved. So, peaceful and content ... no one would ever imagine you are a force 
to be reckoned with. My little warrior love. And a delicious lover. Mm ... perhaps we can do 
an encore before we arrive at the underdark. Which reminds me ... we have to choose which 
way to enter. Mh ... perhaps the grove? I’ll have to run it by her before we decide. I have a 
feeling she’s not in the mood for fighting. 
He stood up, got dressed and stepped outside the tent. It was still very bright out, but he was 
safe. He decided to go sit near the fire and just watch the day go by. There wasn’t much to do 
for him, and he wasn’t hungry either. The fact that Tav would likely offer a nibble at some 
point soon also allowed him to relax. He was grateful for her and what she was willing to do 
for him, a man who had nothing to his name but the clothes on his back, and for her that was 
not a problem. 
I wonder where he’s gone off to? Oh! Where’s my book? Oh, there it is. I want to surprise 
him, but I want a frame to put it. If I ever find a mirror, though, that’ll be funny. At least to 
me. Well, rise and shine, ya potato! You gotta bathe. You smell like sex. 
She blushed at her last thought. She could still feel his touch on her skin, and it gave her a 
little jolt. It would take a wile until she got used to being intimate with him enough that she 
wouldn’t react so strongly.  
Still wearing his shirt and nothing else but her shoes, she stepped out the tent, too, and 
headed in his direction. She walked slowly, for there was no hurry. Then from his back, she 
hugged him tight while smelling his hair. 
“Hello, my beautiful. How are you feeling?”, she said while kissing his neck.  
He was taken a little by surprise, but quickly recovered. Then he grabbed her, pulling her 
towards his front and sitting her on his lap. Now, with Tav in his arms, he looked at her, just 
enjoying the sight and finally he kissed her.  
He gave her a loving smile that lit up her eyes. “I am feeling even better now, my love. What 
are your plans for now?” 
“Well, I was thinking of taking a bath in the water over there first. I feel a little sticky, and I’m
 embarrassed that I stink like sex. I don’t know, but I think I do.”, she said sheepishly. 
He raised an eyebrow in curiosity, not really sure if she indeed could smell herself. He knew 
that she did have a musky scent which was mostly his own on her skin and blood. He did 
feed on her and that passed some venom to her bloodstream. 
“About that. I’d like to give my two cents before you do.” 
Now it was her who had a curious stare. She stood up from his lap and instead sat on the 
ground, looking at him intently. 
“What’s on your mind?” 
“I think it would be a good idea to mask your scent with mine as much as possible. What I 
mean is, we are going to the underdark and there’s only two of us now, so I think if we both 
smell like a vampire, it reduces the chances of grabbing unwanted attention from other 
things. That and I also love how you smell right now, a little of me and you during our love 
making. It’s thrilling.”, he said with a serious tone, really hoping she would comply, but was 
not to be surprised if she said no. He knew her to be rather fussy about hygiene.  
She gave a little pout while she frowned. She was really thinking hard about the pros and 
cons of his request. She was already feeling annoyed that her skin felt sticky, but she was 
uncomfortable thinking how her privates would smell, knowing how they both climaxed, 
and it ran down her a bit. She certainly was uncertain of how to have it both ways. 
“I don’t know, Astarion. I think now that we’re talking about it, I will feel very itchy just 
knowing I need to clean myself and I choose not to. It’s already starting.”, she said as she 
started to wiggle while sitting, trying to scratch an itch on her bum.  
He couldn’t help but burst out laughing at the sight. Then he gave her his typical mischievous
 look. She stopped wiggling and started to disagree with turning her head from left to right.  
“Well, you could bathe now, and then I can mark my scent again.” 
“No, I ... you shouldn’t ... what if ... what if I can’t walk right after? You took me out, and I’ve 
just recovered my energy, but my mobility, not so much.”  
Then in a bit of a whisper, “I can still feel you inside me.” She clasped her hands on her 
mouth in shock. She was surprised with her self at such a candid revelation. 
“Mm ... I was wondering about that. I sort of noticed you were still ... well, rather wet down 
there. How Delicious. It’s becoming rather difficult to not make love to you right here, right 
now.” 
She laughed and shocked herself again when her perverse thought escaped her lips.  
“Well, I could always use my mouth.”  
Her eyes widened in horror and stopped laughing, turning crimson all over. She was always 
curious about doing that, but to say it out loud was too much, even for her. 
He raised both eyebrows in shock. He never imagined her to be so sexually daring, especially 
since he was her first man, and if he could help it, the only man she was and will ever be 
with. But, at the same time, he was thrilled that she was so willing to be open to having a 
healthy sex life, even if it was with a vampire spawn. It was very alluring to him. 
“You know, I think I will take you up in the offer. After all, you’re the type to be reciprocal in 
the relationship and what is more reciprocal than doing for me what I will gladly do for 
you.”, he shifted himself from sitting to his knees and began to seductively crawl to Tav.  
He pushed her softly to the ground with one hand while he parted her left leg with the other. 
He wanted her open to receive him, or at least to tease her already wetness with the cloth of 
his pants.  
Her heart beat shot up, as did her breathing. Her surprised expression turned to a lustful 
gaze. They had no hurry to leave, and it would be hours until sundown.  
This man will have to carry me everywhere if he continues to seduce me. I can’t say no to his 
charm. I’m still not recovered from our last time, but my body burns for him more and more. 
I want more. 
She reached for him, grabbing his shirt and pulling him towards her, and kissed him 
passionately. This time it was her who opened his lips and found his tongue. Her body jolted 
upwards, her heat looking for his cool skin. Her body had a mind of its own for her legs once 
more clasped around his waist, pulling him down on her, his legs now extended in between 
hers. She began to hump as she kissed him. Her right hand firmly grabbing the back of his 
head kneading the scalp, enjoying the softness of his curls while her left hand was strongly 
holding his back, going under his arm and almost clawing her nails to his skin. 
This woman is not of this world! What do you want to do to me, pet? Don’t stop. 
“Mm ...”, Astarion found himself moaning in delight at this aggressive show of dominance 
even though she was pinned under him. She certainly was full of firsts and surprises, and he 
was completely into it. 
She finally let go of his lips, but not his hips. She continued to rub herself on his crotch. The 
only thing in the way of penetration were his pants, but not for long. 
“Oh, Tav. You will be the death of me.”, he panted. 
“No, you’re my life, my love, my all. Fuck me, Astarion. Make me yours. I don’t want to 
forget I’m yours.”, she panted in his ear, trying to suppress her orgasm. 
He used one of his hands to unbutton some buttons of his pants. He knew he would not be 
able to lose all his clothes, but that didn’t matter. All that mattered was that his woman was 
demanding he fucked her with passion, and her wish was his command.  
He guided his already hardened member out of his pants and placed his tip right at her 
opening. It was wet and ready to receive him. But her walls were too swollen with blood. She 
was mid-orgasm, and he would have to push hard to penetrate her. So he did, but it was 
making his head swirl. He couldn’t concentrate. He could only push in and out of her this 
time. They were like animals in heat right now, and that’s all they could manage. 
“Tav, what you do to me... Ah ... mmm ... woman ... relax your body, or I won’t last long.” 
He began to thrust in with force, out, in, out, faster, and faster, in, out. His moans of passion 
combined with hers. In, out, in, out, in, out. He pinned her shoulders down with force, a snarl
 forming on his face. In, out, in, out. He looked at her like a lion looks at his prey. In, out, in, 
out.  He was feeling the same build up from before, inside his groin. It started to hurt, but he 
wanted it to hurt. In, out, in, out. Her eyes were turning white, her silent screams, her strong 
moans, all of it was for him. In, out, in, out. His eyes were turning white, too, but no, he had 
to hold on, just a little more.  
Tav reached for his lips again and began to kiss him with the same intensity with which he 
was penetrating her. She loved this. It was wild, animalistic. She wanted him in every way. 
Then she turned her face to suck on his neck. She wouldn’t bite him, but she could suck on 
his skin like he does to her. Her body was on fire again, and it was all for him. He tried to pull
 away a little. 
“No, fuck me like this. Push harder in me, please. I need you ... Ah ... Mmm ... Astarion... 
Ah ... Asta ... mmm ... harder ... mmm ... please ... more ... come inside me ... love, please ... 
Yes, yes, yes ... ah ... fuck me ... ah ... do it ... Mm ... Yes. Aaaaaah!”  
He kept pushing inside as he felt her body contract inward in her orgasmic climax, but she 
shouted. 
“Bite me, Astarion. Please, feed.” 
“My love.”, he whispered as he climaxed inside her while he bit her neck and allowed her 
blood inside him. This blood was always different. Now it was a little thicker but rich with 
her hormones. It made his mind numb. He had to stay in control of the bite, but it just felt so 
good. 
He licked the drops that came out of the bite marks, but he didn’t stop thrusting. The build 
up was coming again, and her arched back and buckled legs were still going strong. In, out, 
in, out. 
“ASTARION! AH! ...MMM … AH! I’M COMING! DON’T STOP! AH!”, she climaxed again, 
but this time her body went limp and just a faint smile replaced her orgasmic bliss. 
“AH! TAV! TAV! MMM … AH! TAKE ME! OH, GODS! MMM! TAV! AH!” 
He felt his explosion once again enter her body and grinned. It felt delicious to him, knowing 
that he was filling her up with his cum, his venom. He could not turn her. He could not 
impregnate her. But he could lay his claim by having her absorb his essence from the inside. 
That thought made him thrust a little more to result in one final ejaculation before his body 
finally went limp with exhaustion. A smile on his face.  
Both felt rather naughty at the thought that they were still lingering with their previous 
passionate love making and now, like animals in heat, went at it again on the dirt. But they 
felt bliss they’ve never had before. Their needs were being met, and no one was forcing them 
to do it. They allowed their bodies to take over and just have a good hard fuck. 
He rolled over from her, his penis limp and wet. He didn’t bother putting it back inside his 
pants. He just stared at his Tav with a stupid happy smile on his face and half closed eyes. 
She on the other hand was panting still with the same stupid look on her face and her legs 
still spread apart. She could feel a cool breeze begin to dry the secretions they both released in
 their orgasms. 
“I love you, my star. To the moon and back. I do.” 
“I love you, my Tav. My true sun.” 
They both laughed at how lovey and annoying they sounded, but they meant it. Even when 
fucking like dogs in heat, they knew their love was real. Besides, they were making up for lost
 time. They avoided each other’s presence before, and now they didn’t know if they’d have a 
chance to make love once they got to the 7 thousand. In a way, they both knew that now was 
the best time to literally fuck each others’ brains out, and they were glad they had the chance. 
They stayed on the ground looking at each other in silence a couple minutes more. Then he 
broke the silence. 
“Tav, I was thinking about how to enter the underdark.”, he mused, not taking his eyes from 
her. 
She laughed. Here they were again, smelling of sex, covered in dirt, and now he was 
switching to ‘business’ mode. 
“Do you have an idea of where to enter from?”, she asked, still looking at him with half 
closed eyes, still enjoying her rush. 
“I have a feeling you don’t want to go in while having to fight your way through, am I 
correct?” 
“Indeed.” 
“So, perhaps the blighted village?” 
“Is that the one where we have to jump down? My feather falling still needs work, so …” 
“No, this one has an old temple. It used to be for Selune, but it was desecrated long ago. 
There are some entrances where, if sneaky, we can bypass most of the things that live there 
now. So, what do you think?” 
“I think, I just might like this idea. I was wondering which would be best, but I had forgotten 
of this one. Didn’t we go through this one before?” 
“Yes, but it was very near the time we met, so we were certainly all on edge.” 
Tav laughed as she recalled that they were still very cut-throat at that time, and most of the 
group was wary of Astarion and his affliction. 
“Yeah, I remember. All the rest warned you about trying to bite them. That’s why I offered 
myself. I mean, truth be told, I didn’t have feelings for you then, but I did feel we were all 
useful. I decided to use myself as a hook to keep you around.”  
Her cheeks flushed once again, as they did when she was a little embarrassed. 
“Well, I’m glad you did. You were my first, too, you know. My first ever thinking being. I’m 
very blessed we are here now like this.” 
“Panting because we can’t seem to stop fucking?” 
“Not entirely, but I do enjoy your body very much. It’s invigorating and soft, and sexy, and 
everything good in the world.” He turned himself over to get on top of her again.  
Feeling how his flacid member began to harden as it touched her matted hair and lip folds. 
“Well, I enjoy your body very much, too, Sir.” 
“Sir?, So, am I a formal stranger to you, ma’am?” 
“Perhaps, you are, Sir. Have you seen a marble statue with great hair? He’s gorgeous and 
very sassy.” 
“No, I don’t think I have. Could you perhaps describe him a little better?” 
“Certainly. His eyes are like crimson rubies, full of sparkle. His eyebrows and hair are while 
like fresh snow. He’s got a manly, strong stare that could melt the hardest alloys. His 
cheekbones can cut through diamond. His jaw line is stronger than the hardest steel. Oh! And
 his lips, delicious pink plump lips that are so kissable, you’ll go mad if you can’t kiss them.  
“Oh, tell me more. I might have seen him”, he said now fully on top of her, pinning her down
 while looking at her face. 
“His smile, a fierce sight. He’s got perfect teeth, but get this, he’s got fangs. He’s a vampire. 
He’s my vampire. Then his strong neck that leads to his masculine shoulders. I think he’s 
divine, but he’s forgotten that he is, that’s why he’s with me. And let’s not talk about his 
amazing body, muscles, waist, even his ass. The many times I’ve lost my mind while seeing 
him walk in front of me. He’s just too, much perfection in one body.” 
He kissed her again, finding her tongue and, this time, sucking on it. She moaned, for she 
didn’t expect it. He was making her wet again. He wanted one more for the road. 
“Have you seen him?”, she managed to moan out. 
“As a matter of fact, yes. Let me introduce him in you.” 
Her eyes opened fully as she felt him enter again. In, out, in, out. This time with such an 
urgency to climax together. She didn’t speak this time. She just let her body burn up in their 
passion. Her legs shook, her back curled, her buttocks spasmed, she could control nothing but
 just take him in and out.  
Her mouth opened, but no words could come out.  
His lips kissed hers and moved to her neck then her breasts. She would suck on whatever she 
could find. He nibbled on her nipples, causing them to bleed a little, and then he would clean 
her blood. Then go back to sucking her tongue and biting her lips and neck. He was feeling 
hot, but it was because of her. In, out, in, out. Each thrust wanting to go deeper but stopping 
right at cervix. That was his new favorite feeling, touching her pulsating cervix with his hard 
member dripping with his newly found cum. 
He kept pushing in and out, having his hardened member squeezed by her vaginal walls. He 
knew this friction would cause her some swelling later, but it was so hard to stop. 
He was so hard he had to fuck her hard again in order to stop. She was spread-eagle, 
enjoying how the cloth of his pants rubbed her clitoris. That was until he got one of his 
fingers wet with her own cum from her vagina and began rubbing her out while still going in,
 out, in, out, in, out. Hard and deep.  
She started to shake in such a passion she was sure to explode. Until they did. They finally 
reached a climax. Her legs spread so wide, he could have fallen inside her passion. His bach 
arched again, while filling her up right to her open cervix. He could feel how a bit of suction 
happened for his tip was right there begging to be filled with his cum. So, his body did what 
it was meant to, he filled her up again. He felt his buttocks contract and his back arch. A loud 
moan escaped his throat while his song bird joined his song. 
At this rate, they might never walk again, but they were fine with that. 
Their bodies went limp, but this time he didn’t roll off. They stayed like that for a while, his 
penis now limp inside her, her walls still swollen thus trapping him inside. Her breathing 
was the only thing making an echo in the cave’s floor. 
Both whispered, “I love you.”, before succumbing to yet another moment of restful sleep. 
They were exhausted. 
A couple of hours passed and they both startled awake. They heard a noise outside the cave 
and their eyes shot open.   
“What was that?”, asked Tav still trying to come back from her sleep. 
“I don’t know, but I’m going to find out.”, said Astarion, just realizing they were out cold on 
top of each other, even his member stayed inside her.  
Oh, how sweet, but I have other matters to attend, my beautiful. 
They stood up and tried their best to fix themselves up. There was still some light out, so Tav 
grabbed his arm to slow him down. She was nervous about him being too close to the light. 
He agreed to her command.  
She went outside and saw a couple of bear cubs running after each other and couldn’t sense 
any other danger. She climbed up the nearest tree, just to make sure she was just being 
paranoid about any true danger lingering around. That’s when she saw a familiar silhouette.  
“It’s Halsin?!”, she shouted at Astarion as she quickly came down the tree. 
“Halsin? What the hell is he doing here?” 
She shrugged her shoulders to show she had no idea, but she was happy that she saw Halsin. 
“You think it’s a good idea if we call him over?”, she wondered out loud while looking back 
at the entrance. 
“I honestly think it’s not necessary. We don’t know what he’s doing, and he can’t follow us. 
Perhaps it’s just best to let him do his thing.” 
“Very well, but I figure that if he ventures too close to us, we should say hello.” 
“That seems fair. Let’s do that. By the way, how is the daylight?” 
“It’s getting closer. Perhaps we should start packing up?” 
Astarion stretched his back while looking at her disheveled state. She indeed needed a bath 
and clean clothes that were hers. “Tell you what. I’ll start packing our things, and you get 
some food and drink in you. It’s been hours since your last meal.” 
She gave him a big grin. “That’s a fantastic plan.” 
She went inside the tent and took out both packs to allow him to start packing as well as to 
allow her to rummage through them for her food and drink. 
She found a loaf of bread and took some, but then she found the extras: some dry meat and 
some hard cheese. “Oh! Goodie! I got extras! Life is good!”, she mused with an even broader 
grin. 
He realized she hadn’t noticed it, but was glad it made her happy. She didn’t have to hunt for
 food tonight herself. He kept doing his work as he watched her prepare her food and drink 
and subsequently began to eat. 
It didn’t take too long for either to complete their task. He was ready to head out by the time 
she finished her small meal.  
“So, I really want to take a quick swim before we go.”, she said out loud, hopeful he’d agree. 
He finally relented. After all, he’d gotten his way far too many times just today. He gave her a
 smile. She smiled back. 
Then she headed out the entrance to check again. The sky was going from red-orange to 
purple. It was safe for him to step out. She waved him over, and he walked carefully paying 
attention to his own body. No one wanted fatal mistakes. 
“Mm, it’s a nice night out.”, he mused more to himself.  
Tav feeling a little impatient, grabbed his arm and almost dragged him over to the lake they 
had seen earlier. She then undressed and got in. He followed. 
“The water sure feels nice. Mm, I wonder, would you have some soap with you by any 
chance?”, she asked. 
“I’m afraid I don’t. Sorry. I completely forgot to get some from the Inn.” 
With a bit of a pout on her lip, “Mm … that’s unfortunate. Perhaps in our next stop we can 
buy some, or I can make some.” 
He was surprised at her knowledge to make goods, but then he remembered she’s a ranger 
and those folks are full of surprises.  
As he was looking at her, a moving shadow caught his attention. Tav noticed him and 
ducked under the water. She was positioning her self to attack with which ever rock she 
could get from the bottom of the river bed.  
Then Astarion shouted, “Halsin!? What in the hells?!” 
“Astarion, my friend! Nice to see you here! But, wasn’t there someone with you?” 
As soon as he asked that, Tav went up while dropping her makeshift weapon.  
“Halsin! Hello! How are you? What are you doing in these woods?” 
“I am about to ask the same to you?” 
 Halsin took a big whiff and gave a knowing smile. It was obvious to him that these two have 
mated and haven’t stopped. Even in the water, her scent was strong in Astartion and his was 
even stronger in her. He was curious at how that could be. He guessed if she fed him her 
blood, that would explain her scent on him, but how did Astarion manage to become stronger
 in her? 
 Halsin would have never imagined that Astarion was able to ejaculate, and he’d been doing 
that too often and deeply inside her. Her body was absorbing his venom ejaculate and 
entering her blood stream. He simply didn’t figure that this was Astarion’s way of protecting 
her. She was starting to smell like a vampire, though it was a weaker fragrance than his.  
 Halsin looked at Astarion and gave him a knowing smile.  
 “Clever.” 
Astarion agreed with his head then walked out of the water. He turned to Tav.  
“Would you like some privacy, love?” 
She was unsure of allowing Halsin to see her bare, but it would just be easier to suck it up 
and just walk out and get dressed.  
 “It’s fine. Halsin is a gentleman, and he will look away as I get out.” 
“And Astarion?”, Halsin laughed. 
“He’s already laid his claim. I doubt there is an inch he hasn’t seen.”, she said while giving 
him a wink. 
Their greeting and chatter was short-lived. Halsin was watching over the bear cubs from 
before, and mentioned that Minsk and Boo had stayed at the camp. He also showed them the 
stone Gale had given them. As for the other two, they quickly explained their odd plan. 
“So, you already have a way to enter, then? That’s good. I wish you luck.”, said he with a 
smile. 
 In that time, both Astarion and Tav had gotten dressed and were ready to head out. It was 
proper dark now. They had the freedom to move about now without the worry from the 
light. As for other possible assailants, that was another story.
