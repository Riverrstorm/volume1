CHAPTER 13 From road bumps to baby bumps
 Her trip on her cart was short-lived. She must have advanced about 2 meters before 
losing momentum. She laughed some more, for she thought it was silly to do so, but she 
had to be careful. She was pregnant after all. 
She got off her little cart and began to push it again. It wasn’t heavy for her, but the 
terrain was not ideal.  She needed to focus on her lie in case she met any patrol, she 
could see movement in the distance despite the hot sun baking everything in sight. 
Mm-… I’m guessing the pregnant thing will have to stick. What else can I-…? 
She laughed at the idea, but she thought it cleverly fitting. 
I’m so sorry, my love, but your albino condition should suffice to keep you in the tent 
and out at night. But, what else?
 Her mischievous smile from ear to ear couldn’t get any bigger. She was clearly enjoying
 adding layers to her lie and use her supposed fragility against them. Who? The Paladins, 
of course. The ever self-righteous lot. She was really hoping to be right about them 
sticking to their guns and protect the weak and defenseless, like her albino, frail husband
 and her.
 After all, she was on her third attempt.
 Let’s see. Before, I said we have family in Berdusk, so I’ll just keep that. Then, this is 
my third child and hoping it makes it. I buried my babies last year? I guess-… Maybe, a 
doctor told me that I’m the problem, but I think it’s both of us. His curse and my-… bad 
blood? Bad blood-… 
Her lie broke a little. She did feel like she had bad blood. But she wasn’t going to allow 
her mind bring back the family she was born into. They abandoned her, and her blood 
was hers now. And it was magical. She thought of Astarion stuck back at the tent and 
smiled. 
He’s going to hate the albino thing. I can’t wait! Let’s see-… I think that should be 
enough and some water works if needed. Now, I just have to perhaps wobble? Mm-… 
Perhaps that is too much. I’m just sticking out my belly and it barely shows anything.
 She laughed, for making this story up was too much for her. Sure, some of her lies could
 be linked back to her truth, but it was of no consequence. Her lie needed to protect them 
enough to cross the River Chionthar from Berdusk, and then they would head north to 
the Emerald Grove first. She hoped with all her heart that they would be doing well.
 She kept walking forward and was starting to feel like the river kept moving further and 
further away. It was a hot mid-summer afternoon, and it felt like the sun had a personal 
vendetta with anything it touched, including her, especially her. But she was a woman 
with a mission: must wash socks!
 After a couple more minutes, she finally got near enough to the river to smell the smells 
and to see the Paladin Patrols, too. If you can see them, they can see you. So, she began 
to play up her physical discomfort. She was such a poor, unfortunate soul right about 
now, while Astarion was fresh at the tent. 
“Stupid rogue-… how dare he get me pregante?”, she giggled to no one.
As she kept moving forward, feeling the bumpiness of the road, and how the cart just 
jiggled happily away as it was pushed, her mind wandered away into memories of her 
most recent adventures. Never had she imagined half of what she lived through. The 
Nether brain? Being chosen to be part of it? Her of all people? But, in a way she was 
thankful. 
She was thankful that despite such a horrid situation with a parasite in her brain and the 
impending doom, she met who she now considers family. She’d still be living moving 
about from the Forest of Lethyr to Rawlinswood and back again. But now she was really
 off her known map. She’d stared off in The Great Wild Wood where her family’s home 
continued to cause strife. She’d walk as much as her legs had allowed her from town to 
town and from river to river. Never easy, but at least better. 
Once she came back from her thoughts, she had finally arrived at the river’s edge. The 
river looked nice enough. She only knew that there was going to be a lot of movement 
because this river happened to be important to this region of Elturgard. So far, her 
friends had simply warned her to be very careful because of recent events with Elturel 
resulted in its people being even more suspicious of her kind and of Astarion’s. Lucky 
for her, she was stubborn enough to defy their whole world to find safe passage through 
their land and into what would soon become hers.
 It had been a lingering thought in her mind. What was the Underdark like? She paid 
attention and when they went the first time, she was too busy with the errands they took 
that she didn’t get time to really notice. Minthara talked about her view of it, but it was 
limited and strange customs similar to the ones from her own blood-kin. Tav had no 
intention in joining that again. She was free and was going to keep it like that. Not even 
the parasites in the sky were able to strip her from her hard won freedom. 
Freedom and choice. Her mantras that have kept her alive and on the move. In a way, 
this was the core of her love for her pale elf. He had none. He received it on accident. 
She was there to bare witness. In truth, she knew her gang of misfits had a similar 
situation of freedom and choice. All of them had lost theirs and the parasites in a way 
pushed them into it. The difference was that Astarion was more active in his wooing. 
She was hurt when he revealed that he only gave her the attention in an attempt to gain 
her favor and protection. He used her for personal gain. But while he had been using his 
cruel behavior of years to ensure his survival, she genuinely took a liking to him. 
Perhaps it was her years of solitude that allowed him to weasel his way into her heart 
then, but she did like him. A lot. And possibly more than she should have.
 It was even obvious to her that her other friends in a way also took a liking to her, 
though she didn’t truly understood why. It wasn’t until Karlach sat her down and told 
her.
 “Listen, soldier. You have something about you that people like. I guess for me is that 
you’re very forgiving. Even when you don’t know a person. I mean, you gave me a 
chance and even fought Wyll because of it and you met him first.”
 “But that’s because he was wrong. He didn’t even know you. He just said horns equals 
bad. That’s stupid.”
 “Yeah, it is. But then Gale. You stuck your hand on a portal in a rock. You could have 
died. I don’t know if I would have done it myself. I’m glad you did, though. He’s a 
pretty great guy, a little weird, but great.”
 “Yeah, I thought that was going to be a trick, but if I had been in a similar situation, I 
would like someone to throw me a rope. I like Gale. He’s like a brother to me.”
 “Hahaha! Much to his dislike. But I think he has gotten over it.”
 “What do you mean?, Tav said, cheeks flushing red.
“That face tells me you know what I mean. But Astarion beat all of us to the punch, I 
guess. Lucky thief, but he is a rogue, so-…”
 “WHAT?! YOU KNOW ABOUT-…”, she shut her mouth, her hand shutting it for her.
 Karlach cackled while almost dropping her bottle of wine. 
“Oh, Tav. I’m sorry, but yes. We all heard YOU specifically. He was trying to not make 
a lot of noise himself, but we heard him, too. He didn’t take you far enough. Lucky, dog!
 Hahaha But, he was quicker to get your attention. Had we placed bets, mine would have 
been on Wyll, but you’ve been so aloof. It’s like you are new to this world and 
everything catches your attention. Then Astarion moved ever so swiftly to catch your 
attention and that was it. You locked on him.”
 “This is embarrassing. You heard-… I mean-… I-… He was my first everything.”
 Tav revealed her embarrassing truth. Now she doesn’t find it so, but then she was new to
 feelings, intimacy, and friends to talk to about it.
 “Really?! Well, now I am really jealous! But, as long as you are happy and he treats you 
well.”
 “I think so. I don’t know-… I don’t know what ‘well’ is, though. He is certainly nothing 
like my family back in-… I’m just saying that so far I don’t feel that he is forcing me to 
do anything I don’t want to. And I like his attention on me. The way he looks at me 
when he thinks I’m not looking-… it makes my heart race.”
 “That could be because he is a vampire. Not gonna lie, the fact that you keep offering 
yourself, so he keeps off our necks-… you are truly something else and completely mad.
 Never change.”
 “Karlach-… Thank you for being my friend. I love you.”
Karlach was a bit surprised of the L word, but felt the same. She knew that whatever 
happened, Tav would always be there to help or just be. 
“I love you, too, soldier.”
 Tav had been walking along the river’s edge lost in her thoughts while lazily scouting 
the area. She saw some potentially useful herbs and some rocks that caught her attention.
 As she had been pushing her little cart, she was using it as a sort of crutch. She was very 
much ‘pregante by her albino husband’ that she needed the support.
 She began to practice her scenes under hear breath while checking that no one was near 
enough to hear her. But, I spoke too soon. She saw a trader barge with two fishermen 
getting closer to where she was and a little over, there was a Paladin Patrol. From being 
alone to having way too many guards was certainly uncomfortable. It was time for her 
best performance.
 As she slowed down, she put her hand on her stomach and winced a little. In reality the 
banishment brand that had been placed on her by her mother with some arcane magic 
did actually hurt a little when she placed her hand over it. An unfortunate reminder that 
perhaps she would never have the joy, but she didn’t kid herself.
 What does it matter? If I can’t because of this-… it’s not like Astarion could do it 
anyway. And the thought of having any other-… I’d rather set myself on fire than be 
taken by another. It’s fine-.. It’s-…
 She felt how her eyes started to water, so she took a deep breath to steady her thoughts. 
It was show time.
She let go of her emotional support “Helen Wheels” and wobbled to the edge of the 
river. She was a sad sight what with her hand on her stomach and her worried face baked
 by a relentless sun. Her boots splashed by the water, just a woodland creature doubting 
about bending down to drink or just drown in the water.
 She lifted her right arm to get the attention of the barge. She had her first idea. If they 
were any kind of merchants, she might get lucky. She wanted buckets and as gods as her
 witnesses, she was going to get at least one.
 The first to take notice was their guard, their Hellrider armor very obvious, tiefling 
female, very stern looking. She was the first to speak.
 “M’lady-- you’re looking ill. Perhaps the river isn’t safe for you lest you fall in”, 
shouted the guard as she motioned the fisherman to move a little closer.
 Tav winced as she gave a friendly smile, then exhaled and took a step back. 
“Nothing to worry about, friend. It’s just this little one is causing a stir. Say, would you 
happen to be merchants, too?”, she shouted back as she kept touching her stomach while
 trying to keep a smile.
 “Aye! We have if you have coin!”, shouted one of the men. 
Scruff looking, with a no nonsense look about him. Skin like leather due to the hot, 
baking sun. All of them had the same look about them except their hired guard. She 
wasn’t too friendly looking, but at least Tav felt safer trying her ruse with a woman first.
 “Aye, I do!”, she said as she bent over a little wincing in pain. 
She then recuperated. As she looked at them again, she saw that the man who last spoke 
and the guard where now boarding a smaller boat to reach her, worried faces clearly on 
them. It was working, sympathy points. She’d sure bless them after this, for she still felt 
bad about needing to use this ploy, but Astarion and her safety depended on it.
 As she grabbed on to the cart again, breathing heavy, she shouted, “Oh, I’m sorry for the
 inconvenience. I could have-… swam to you.”
 The guard was now paddling towards her with the fisher man helping. They moved 
quickly fearing they might have a sick woman by the river or worse. Fortunately, they 
arrived quick enough to really see what was going on. 
The Hellrider guard, ever vigilant, got out first and moved towards Tav. She looked like 
a lioness on the prowl assessing curios prey. Tav did her best to look helpless and weak, 
as a proper commoner female with a cart by the river.
 Here we go. If this doesn’t work, I can always take a swim. Hopefully the parasite didn’t
 affect my swimming skills.
 “M’lady, are you sure you sure be here at this time of day. You clearly look ill.”, said 
the guard as she stepped in to try and aid her.
 “Oh, I know, see I have very little choice. This little one wants to come out and be with 
his brothers when it’s not yet time-… Just like them.”
 Even Tav surprised herself at the single tear that rolled down. She’s never been with 
child nor was there one in there, but they didn’t know that. That was the point. 
The fisherman looked at her with a grim look and asked her, “Have you no husband to 
aid you with your task, ma’am?”
 “Aye, that I do. But, my poor dear, I have put him in a difficult predicament. You see, 
his family was cursed and he took the brunt of it, my beloved.”, she held firm on the cart
 to give a pregnant pause.
 She continued, with the saddest ‘woe is me’ look she could imagine, “For you see, my 
beautiful husband, was cursed the ‘ghost-man’ back at the village and this sun might 
take him faster than our child might take me.”
 She tried to give a light laugh. The guard couldn’t help herself and had to ask.
 “Ghost man?”
 “Aye, he was cursed albino. Pale skin like the moon’s light in the darkest night, eyes 
pink on a good day, but when he’s in pain, red as rubies. But he’s a good man. He does 
what he can for us. Problem was my wretched womb. Can barely keep a hope alive. Tis 
our third try. Bless his soul, he keeps trusting I can do it. Anyone else would have gone 
after our first.”
 As Tav looked down in emberrasment, tears fell and splashed on the pebbles on the 
ground as if the souls of her lost progeny would finally buried by the water. Now, her 
face in such a sorrow, she directed her attention to the fisherman. 
“Look at me. A mess. I apologize. My troubles are not of your consequence. I don’t 
want to waste your time, but I am looking to buy.”
 “Not a problem, ma’am. My own woman and I too suffered a loss. It’s not easy to 
recover and I’m guessing for you this was recent.”
“That it was. We’re heading to my parents home, hoping their blessing might help our 
plight. May your wife be blessed with never having to go through this again, fine man.”, 
Tav touched the man’s hand while smiling.
 He felt an odd calming warmth, like a breeze that filled him up with peace as she did 
this. Like an enchantment meant to bring him joy rather than pain.
 The guard was really starting to look more concerned, likely remembering how her own 
kind always struggled by things out of their control. She placed her hand on Tav’s 
shoulder and spoke next.
 “Listen M’lady, you should really go to Berduks, you don’t look so well. Perhaps it is 
your best and safest choice right now. I can arrange for pick up of you and your ill
husband?”
 “Bless you, warrior. Bless you. But you see, we must pick up our belongings first and 
we move slow. Right now, I am looking to buy buckets, preferably metal. My sickness 
has me needed one, especially in the morning. The other-… well, I-… I cannot go in the 
grasslands. My husband helps, but my dear Rupert, he can’t help me during the day lest 
his skin becomes red like a cooked shrimp.”, Tav giggled at this. 
Poor Rupert might have his ears turning red or at least itchy right about now. 
The fisherman finally perked up. This was the sale he was looking for and the first in the
 day, too. As much as he didn’t want to take advantage, both needed something: he 
needed coin and she needed to get rid of it.
 “Ma’am, I may be of service. I so happen to have two buckets of fish available for 
purchase.”
 “Oh, fine man, I am just in need of the buckets, not the fish.”
 “Well, I can offer you as is for 5 gp per bucket.”
 “5 gp?! I’m sorry, I don’t have that kind of money. The money I have is for the medic at 
Berdusk. I’m sorry for your inconvenience. I will try my luck with another barge. Thank
 you.”
 The guard gave him the meanest look, and he simply gulped. It was obvious he was 
spiking his price to try his luck, but the guard wasn’t having with this one at least. 
He stammered his words a little, “Oh,-… Well, given-… given your circumstance, how 
about I make you a deal? 2 gp per bucket o’ fish.? How’s that sound?”
 Tav winced in pain again while holding her brand to make it more realistic.
 “Pardon. The tyke is fussy. Well, I don’t need the fish-… do you by any chance sell salt,
 too?”
 “That I do. That’s 1 gp for a kilo of the best kind anywhere in Elturgard.”
 “I wouldn’t expect any less, fine man. Mm-… How much would you charge for gutting 
them? I mean, the smell-… the guts-… I don’t think I can-…” 
She held her hand to her mouth pretending to be sick. 
“Mm-… I suppose, I can-…” 
Luckily, the guard was still holding her power over him. It was likely that she was not 
just a hired guard, but friend. Despite it all, Tav was still in luck for this situation. The 
Hellrider guard was very helpful with this almost failed interaction.
Tav interjected with her brand of odd-logic all too quickly.
 “Well, I am offering to pay you to gut them. You and yours can use the chum as bait for 
another two buckets and make more profit. And you help a woman with a sickly 
stomach, too. What do you say? Please?”
 Biggest puppy dog eyes he’d ever seen. She might not have the high-elf’s grace, but she 
had her charm.
 Maybe that’s why he was head over heals for her despite his constant complaining, too. 
The fisherman gulped, the guard smiled, and Tav was jumping from joy inside her head.
 Yes! I think that’s a yes.
 “Very well, miss. 2 buckets of fish for 3 gold each, that’s 6 gp. The sack of salt is 1 gp. 
That makes 7gp, and the gutting of the fish, but not the scales, is 3 gp for the 2 buckets. 
That comes to 10 gp.”
 “Oh! thank you, fine man! May many blessings fall on you and yours!”
 She said this as she looked at them both. The guard seem to like this blessing, as for a 
tiefling they were hard to come by.
 “Ma’am, perhaps we can help you cross the river once you and your husband are feeling
 better.?”
 “Oh?! That would be a blessing for us. It’s been years since I’ve visited my parents in 
Berdusk, but they’re getting on in years. If you could help us with information as to who
 or where for our crossing. I want to cross my little cart, too.”
 “There would be no issues. It’s a couple of hours from this point to the proper crossing 
to Berdusk. Once you get there, we are easy to spot when we’re not in route.”
 The fisherman added, “Well, that is if you need night time assistance, then we will be 
there at the dock. It’s during daytime that we might not be.”
 “Oh, that’s logical. Would I be able to take up on your offer tomorrow at night? Say 
after sunset but before midnight? I don’t think I have the energy to make the trek today.”
 “Aye. I’ll be there or one of my brothers will.”
 “How much would that be?”
 “Well, that’s two adults and a mule-… that’s 5 gp.”, he said this time without looking at 
the guard.
 “Mm-.. well, since you are taking the trouble of waiting for us, I’ll give you 6 gp. Thank
 you so much.”
 “Done, then. Let me go and get your items ready.”
 The guard stayed with Tav as the man took the boat back, while shouting directions 
about this sale. Tav looked up at the guard and smiled.
 “You’re one of the good ones. Thank you.”
 “Just in a day’s work, miss. Folks like us should stick together.”
 “Aye, that be true.”
 As they continued to wait in silence, they could see the men move about to get the things
 ready, but Tav gasped. The guard was startled, and turned to look at her.
 “What’s the matter, miss?”
 “I forgot to ask them to sell me a burlap sack. I will need to cover my fish buckets. Oh, 
dear.”, she said with a true worried look. 
They didn’t know she wanted the buckets filled with water to wash laundry, not to carry 
the fish back in them. At this point, the fish were nothing more than a lucky bonus. No 
hunting for her at least. Astarion wasn’t going to be so lucky. He might need to go, but 
she didn’t like the idea much. Too many patrols.
 The guard stepped forward and gave the loudest shout that frightened everyone 
involved.
 “Darvin! Add a burlap sack to her sale! She forgot to add it!”
 Darvin waved back in agreement and moved out of sight to get it. He came into view 
quickly enough.
 “Thank you so much. And I’m so sorry for the inconvenience.”
 “No harm done, miss. Your things will be here soon enough.”
 After a couple more minutes of silence, the man, Darvin, came back with all her items 
purchased. Now, she was the proud owner of two metal buckets, a sack of salt, a large 
burlap sack, and a lot of fish that would last her a while, much to the detriment of 
Rupert. Poor Rupert. 
“Miss, let me load the things to your cart. You think it will handle it. It looks-…”, his 
face was expectant to have the little cart fall into splinters with the weight.
 But he didn’t know that Tav was stubborn and all she touched was given the same give. 
It would hold for she willed it so.
 “It will hold. I just know it will.”, she said with a proud smug look. 
“Very well, here we are. There. All done.”
 “And here you go, young man. I thank you both for your help. I’ll be seeing you 
tomorrow night. Be well.”
 She handed him the money and smiled good bye. It was done. She felt her knees a bit 
shaky because of the situation, but all in all, she had been successful. 
Now I really think I’m going to be sick. This was too much, even for me. But, I have my 
buckets and I got too much fish. That one is going to hate either me, the smell, or both. 
My poor Rupert.
 It was difficult for her not to cackle about her Rupert. If he knew the lies she was 
spreading about him now, he’d have a fit. But she felt happy to know that for now he 
was safe. That’s her first priority. Keep him safe at day time, keep him company at night
 time. She was lucky that she only needed 4 hours of sleep, though. It made it easy to 
keep him company.
 As she saw the boat sail slowly away towards Berdusk, she moved in the opposite 
direction while looking around,“Very well. Now, some plants. Let’s see what you’ve got
 to offer, my beautiful.”
 Meanwhile, our pale-elf stayed laying in bed for a while right after our bog-witch took 
of with her, apparently, mule. He didn’t stay there for long, as much as he wanted to just
 stay there and do nothing but brood, he knew he had to help out. Either that or allow his 
mind to fester in his thoughts again. He knew they had a conversation pending, and 
they’d have to really listen to each other and finally bury the hatchet on it. Before they 
crossed that river, they needed to finalize their alignment with each other before the 
likely fights in the Reaching Woods. 
I swear woman, I’d never thought my self the house husband, but here we are. But, I am 
thankful of how much you do for me to be comfortable in our-… uh, palace.
 He looked at the modifications she had thought, with his help of course, to make the tent
 more comfortable. She was really enjoying having a more ‘stable’ home when compared
 to just living in the forest alone. He remembered a conversation they had when they 
were looking for some random sword in some ruins for coin. She liked to compare her 
old life with her new life, as if everything was a wonder to her. Then he realized the 
reason why. She kept moving. He always had the feeling that she was running away 
from something, or someone, but now he wondered if it was from herself. 
“Back in the forest, I’d stay in a good sturdy tree during the day. But with the gang, you 
all like to stay put for longer. I like it”, she beamed up at him as she kept rummaging 
through some barrils.
 He raised his eyebrow in question, “Huh? What? You didn’t have a tent or-…?”
 “Oh, no. I didn’t have money nor the idea of how to make one. Before, the houses were 
already made. I was just there, but then I wasn’t. So, I just looked at the animals and 
other beings and copied how they moved. The forests are not very forgiving to those 
alone, even worse if you stay put.”
 “Mh. And I’m here thinking you probably had a cabin hidden somewhere.”
 “Nah, all I have is usually on me-… was usually on me. Then the brain thing happened. 
When I woke up, all I had was my clothes. I don’t think I’ll ever get my old pack back.”
 “You had something important in it?”
 “Nah, I’ve got better gear and skills now-… because of you-… I mean-… all of you.”
She backtracked. By now, she really enjoyed his company, but couldn’t help get a little 
flustered. She didn’t want him to feel weird if he found out she was taking a liking to 
him at that point. But, he did take notice. She smelled sweet, flowery, but with an earthy 
tone. And when her cheeks turned red, she smelled the strongest. He also enjoyed that 
she felt embarrassed when she let it slip that she was taking a liking to him without him 
trying. This was new to him, too. 
And to think that I, who seduced thousands upon thousands of unfortunate fools, ended 
up falling for the dumb girl who still blushes at my gaze and touch. Yet, being covered 
in gore and guts doesn’t faze her. What an impossible woman. But you have kept my 
daggers after all this time.
 He smiled at the thought for it was these little things that he needed to accept as acts of 
love. Perhaps to him it was nothing, but to her it was special. She had no good gear, just 
skill. So, together they all began to rebuild their armor, weapons, and even creature 
comforts. He had found those daggers and thought they were pretty, a little plain, but not
 too heavy. Tav was using a knife with a serrated edge on one side and a smooth side on 
the other. It was more for doing tasks in a forest, not for battle.
 So, he thought of her and her size. They were perfect, light weight, pretty enough, and 
deadly in her capable hands. Even then, he knew that she was very capable of fighting 
and defending, which was in part why he was swift in getting her attention at first. His 
best defender or best protector depending on the situation. 
He even remembered when he couldn’t help himself that night, while she was sleeping 
under the stars. She was there, peaceful and happy. This was the first time he realized 
that Tav tended to smile when she slept unless she was feeling ill or angry, which was 
rare. 
That night, he lost control enough to get close, so close. She smelled wonderful and was 
deep asleep. He bent down, he exhaled and his cool breath was the reason why she 
woke. When she did, she was shocked, but for the wrong reason. She revealed to him 
time after that she thought he wanted to kiss her.
 To his surprise, she bought it. She was the first thinking being that fed him in 200 years. 
That level of trust is impossible to find anywhere and yet, she hasn’t stopped since.
 She’s certainly been created to be my ruin.
 Now, properly dressed, looking dashing as always, he began to gather the things he need
 for his first house-husband task: sharpen and oil their weapons. The had to be ready and 
nothing was too small today. Everything must be checked, mended, sharpened, or oiled. 
Besides, it gave him something to do before he went stir-crazy. But it won’t be long 
until he does, the tent is only 5x5 m. 
Rummaging through both travel packs, his being the bigger one, he got his things: a 
whetstone he joinked from Lae’Zel, strops which Tav made months ago, oil which he 
also took, but this form Wyll. Always, a rogue after after all. He cackled at this. He 
suspected they took notice, but said nothing. Perhaps it was because the ‘defacto’ leader 
had his back or perhaps because they did take a liking to him. At least, that’s what Tav 
swore on.
 “I wonder how much longer that woman will take? How long has it been? 5 hours?”
 It hadn’t even been one, 30 minutes tops. As he was brooding in his little home cage, he 
decided to sit on the bed of pelts to first sharpen all blades. He started with hers, and 
took great care in his work. After all, he was perfect, so his craftsmanship must be equal 
to him. But, he had no choice but to let his mind wander to all the spaces he tried to not 
visit.
 “Today, I will teach you how to make arrow shafts. Astarion, pay attention!”
 “Oh, fine. But why must I learn this menial task? I don’t shoot arrows. That’s all you. 
And may I say how delicious you look when you do?”
 She blushed at that, but she wasn’t going to fall for his tricks. He was supposed to be full
 in more way than one.
 “Be-… because, I need your help. You work faster than I do. And you are great at 
making them straight. Also, they end up being better than mine. But, fine. Go and run 
along. You don’t have to learn.”
 “Well, I do have superior skills than most. Of course, I’ll help you. What do I have to 
do?”, he swatted his hands and arms like the arrogant idiot he pretended to be.
 But by now, he had learned that she would flatter him to get him to do a difficult task. 
Unfortunately for him, it was part flatery and part truth. He was faster working the 
wood, but her quality matched his. She just liked having them be made by him. Then he 
recalled another time when they had just finished their fun after a short fight with some 
gnolls. 
“Now, what on earth are you doing?”
 “These are free. What do you mean? Help me collect them!”
 “You got me to ruin my perfect hands, and now you are collecting-… trash. I’m 
insulted.”
 “Insulted or not, they still work. And free! Oh, move it over, Mr. Perfect.”
 “Well, that I am. But, fine. Here.”
“Besides, these I don’t mind losing. Yours I always have to get back. They’re my 
favorites.”
 “Mh-… I’m glad to hear you appreciate my superior skills.”
 She kissed him on the cheek when he was distracted collecting arrows from bodies or 
the ground.
 “Thank you, my beautiful. You’re superior everything is always top notch.”
 Back at the tent, he kept working the blades with a slime on his faces. His fangs the most
 prominent feature of his alluring smile. A smile which sure got a certain little someone’s
 heart to race, but not out of fear. 
Before long, he was done with this task. He picked up the things he used and then 
inspected his work.
 “Polished to perfection, too. But of course-…”
 He looked toward the entrance flap which was fastened with a leather strap. She left 
nothing to chance. 
“Oh, must’ve been the wind. Any who-… what’s next?”
 What was next was laundry. Not very grandiose for our Fearun’s Champion, but socks 
should be washed in between the calmness of battle. 
He rolled his eyes as he pulled the travel packs closer. He dumped his things on the bed, 
for he knew what was in there, but he took out the things little by little from hers. He 
never knew what kind of odd bottle, tin, or pouch might fall and drop it’s contents. He 
learned that the hard way.
As Astarion covered his nose and mouth, “What is that god awful smell?!”
 Shadowheart shouted at him, “If you don’t know what she keeps in it, stop grabbing her 
things, Astarion!”
 Tav came running, “What did you do?! That took me a week! Now, I’ll have to make 
more.”
 Then Gale almost puking managed to cry, “More?! Why in heavens-…”
 His stomach gave. It got worse.
 Astarion cackled at the memory. The only good thing of that situation was watching 
Gale losing his lunch. But, Tav did make Astarion help her collect the ingredients of her 
liquid. It was the first attempt at masking a scent. Now, she had perfected her brew, but 
back then was potent enough to almost kill Gale. 
So now, all he needed was to grab all the clothes to wash them. From socks to wash 
cloths, nothing would be spared. He decided he would leave the laundry for washing 
near the entrance flap. Then, once again, there was nothing else to do. He put whatever 
he could away and laid on the bed of pelts. Their softness on his skin made him close his
 eyes in joy. These were made by his Tav. She always took great care so they would be 
the softest for him. 
“Better than the best silk, my love.”
 Then a noise startled him. He stood up in one swift move, dagger in hand. It was just a 
snake that slithered too close. He was getting more jittery being here with only his 
thoughts as company. 
As he was going slowly mad, Tav was still at the river collecting plants like a lunatic. 
She didn’t pay much attention to what it was or how much of it. She would deal with 
that later, but for now she just grabbed, stuffed in her sack, repeat. The only care she 
took now was to not touch the poisonous ones. 
Her objective was simple, anything goes and everything is good. Once she’s back at 
camp she’ll see what she can make, but for now, no time should be wasted. As she 
walked the river’s edge, she’d grab cat tail, and bog myrtle; right in the bag. Then she’d 
move away from the cart to get some dandelion: right in the bag. Then the stinging 
nettle would catch her attention and grab that, too. Patch of mint? joink. A bit of yarrow 
root? Take that, too. Watercress? Why not cress? 
She was busy collecting her plants that she didn’t notice the Paladin guard who’d notice 
a “suspicious female collecting herbs”. His kind is very much into everyone’s busyness 
except their own. So, obviously, she had to be stopped lest she offend some god with a 
penchant for disturbing your happiness. 
The paladin shouted at her to get her attention. 
“Woman! You there, ma’am! Halt!”
 Tav was mid-scavenging session with her plants and stuffed sack. She was bent forward,
 so she just placed her hand on her back as she lifted her self up slowly. She wiped her 
forehead and winced a little.
 “Who? Me?”
 “Yes, you. What are you doing by the river’s edge?”
 “I didn’t know I need a permit to be here. Where do I get it?”
 “What?! No, I mean-… commoners don’t have permission to collect witch herbs.”
“Witch herbs? What do you mean? Which is which? Witch herb?”
 The paladin was stunned with the sheer stupid question she just asked. It took all of 
Tav’s power no to laugh at that. She thought it sounded funny, but had to look just as 
confused as him. His companion did laugh at the sheer absurdity of this random 
interaction. 
“What I mean, you people have no permission to be collecting herbs to make your witch
 craft”
 Cue in her pregnant woe is me act. She touched her brand to get a realistic wince and 
perhaps a little tear.
 “Young man,”, she panted, “I’ll have you know that tea is helping me and my child 
survive. I can barely keep anything down. It ends my nausea.”
 “But-…”
 “But nothing, young man! I will not allow your crazy ideas kill this one, too.”, she bent 
over holding her stomach.
 The other guard got closer to help her while holding a hand up to interrupt the 
conversation.
 “Pardon us, ma’am. He’s new and young. He’s learning the ropes. You say this is not 
your first?”
 “No offense taken, but I-… the doctor said this is my last chance-… and tea helps. I’m 
hopeful my dear Rupert and I get at least one blessing. They say third luck’s a charm.”, 
she said this with a pained voice and tearful eyes. 
“I’m s-...sorry, ma’m. I didn’t-…”, the first paladin said looking very embarrassed and 
very red.
 “Why would you? You just saw me and judged me like everyone else! Tyke killer, they 
whisper. You think I want my beloved gifts to go to the heavens before I get to name 
them?! My poor husband blames himself, with his family’s curse, and now my wretched
 womb can’t even hold a whisper. Then I get blamed by strangers-… I just want tea to 
calm my nerves. I’m at my wits end here, soldier.”
 “I’m very sorry, ma’am. We have a decree that we inspect the herbs folks collect. We 
must keep an eye on improper worship and my partner, just thought-…”, tried to explain
 the second palandin before being cut off.
 “Of course, copper skin, pointy ears, walking in the river’s edge. She must be one of 
them. I’ll have you know my mother was bewitched by a wood-elf and then was left to 
raise me alone. We’re not all like, them.”, she lied.
 She was one of them, one of the worse kind of them. She couldn’t help it. Her voice 
broke and her tears escaped  her soul this time. She knew her kind were hated, but to 
remember you hate yourself on the spot while trying to lie to stay alive, it’s a little hard.
 Both Paladins were now clearly uncomfortable and wanting to be anywhere but there. 
“Ma’m, we’ll leave you be.”
 She did her best to compose herself. Now wasn’t the time nor the place for her real 
troubles to surface.
 “Sure, but before you go, I’ll accept your apology if you help me. I need those skins 
filled, and that log secured to my cart with those straps.”, she commanded while looking 
at them defiently.
 She then took her fish and placed them in the burlap sack. Now the cart was starting to 
fill up. She took the buckets to the river, too, and began to give them a quick rinse. 
“No, you. Help me with these buckets. I need water to bathe. Doctors orders. The 2 on 
the cart.”
 She was like a stern grandmother who was no longer tolerating nonsense from her 
misbehaved grand kids. The second paladin helped while laughing. Never in his mind 
did he imagine a short human hybrid would first take offense at being called a fey, 
second get scolded by one for ruining her tea leaf scavenging. The fact that now he was 
repenting by helping her carry water and a log back to her camp was priceless. And it all
 started because of the new guy.
 As for the new guy, he sure had learned his lesson. Never pester a pregnant woman, fey 
or not.
 “Here you go, ma’am. I’m really sorry.”, the first paladin said while he placed the 
second bucket in the cart. 
“Ma’am”, said the second while walking away backwards. Keeping his eyes on Tav as if
 she’d sprout fangs. 
Well, she couldn’t, but her Rupert sure could.
 “Thank you, gentlemen.”
 She waited a little while to make sure they didn’t change their mind and come back to 
finish their job for they weren’t too far off the truth. Thankfully, Tav had gotten rather 
convincing today.
 My goodness! That was the worst! I need to go home and just lay on the floor for a 
couple of hours. Maybe 2, no less, 5. Well, time to get back to my Rupert shrimpstarion. 
I’ll keep that to myself.
 She smirked while she slowly pushed the cart back. But then she stop dead on her tracks.
 “My rocks!”
 She turned left the cart and walked back with her wooden tray in hand, scouted the area 
and found a good spot. She sat down not minding the water and began grabbing 
whatever was useful. Free outweighed quality in her mind. Besides, she’s been using 
nature since she lived in the forests.
 Then, carefully standing up like how she thought a pregnant woman sitting on the floor 
would stand up. She was surely committed to the bit. That and she didn’t know who else
 might be lurking around. So, she wobbled her way to her Helen-cart, placed her tray on 
top of the buckets, and began to push. 
But this was not going to move. At all. It was far too heavy and without Astarion here, 
this cart would be just as stubborn as a mule. So, change of plans. She pushed over her 
elm drift wood to the floor. It landed with a soft thud on the dry grass. 
With an annoyed looked, she told the wood, “We’re dragging ass, my love. But I’m not 
coming back for you. You best roll.”
 She began pushing the cart at a snail pace, while she looked around. She could see some 
armor glint in the distance and a boat. She would have to fake it for a little longer. Push 
the cart. Stop. Drag the log with the leather strap. Stop. Rinse. Repeat. 
She was already spent, and sweaty. Her back hurt from trying to stick out her non
pregnant belly in her bit. 
How do women do it? Heck! How do wolves, they have more? I have nothing and I’m 
already tired.
 She did this for about 5 minutes and advanced just enough to not be able to see folks. If 
you can’t see them, they can’t see you. 
I’m going to have rock hard everything by the time I get home. But, now let’s kick you 
on over, love.
 She began to kick the log with enough force that it would roll a couple of times before 
stopping. Now it was to rinse and repeat. 
Makes me wonder if my Rupert is busy. Times like this I’d like the parasite, so he could 
help… Nah, Astarion tentacles is not it. Ew. 
She cackled at the thought of his drama show if he had turned. We’re glad he didn’t.
 As all these overly nonsensical moments that happened to Tav, our dear Rupert was 
none the wiser back home-… the tent. Doing what little he could, but mostly going stir
crazy with his thoughts inside a cloth cell that wasn’t rather small at now 5 by 5 meters, 
even for Tav. But, it couldn’t be helped. She wanted a poop tent and sacrifices had to be 
made or at least that’s what she claimed. They just had to work their magic fingers to 
rearrange the canvas material from her Tent and his.
 Back at the tent, he dragged himself off the pelts he was lying on and decided to 
something to keep busy again. He was getting even more restless. He was fussing over 
the clothes and armor pieces they had decided to carry with them. He inspected the clean
 items that could use a little mending.
 He took some of his clothes and placed them on the bed to fix up little threads that had 
come lose or torn. Then he took some of Tav’s and winced.
 Honestly, this woman’s fashion sense is criminal. But then again, she’s still in
 the habit of making her own. Well, I suppose it is useful to blend in with the 
environment-… but, must she always be so tight-fitting? My imagination gets the best of 
me with this one.
 He was examining one of Tav’s oldest vests made of black dyed leather, which hugged 
her curvy body in all the right places. To him, she had her wild charm. Her caramel skin 
for starters. She wasn’t tall by any high elf standard and had dark brown hair in soft 
curls. Her eyes dark as night, a button nose, soft thick lips, and a smile that would make 
his heart explode out of his chest, were it to beat again. 
But she was a warrior, a fighter, so she had strong arms and legs. She could take on 
Karlach on a fist fight despite the terrifying height difference where Tav stands at her 
glorious 1.5 meters tall and Karlach is an amazing 1.92 meters tall. Tav would still give 
her a run for her money. Her legs where strong, thick, yet obviously not very long. She 
would be able to beat a mule in a kicking match. He thought that was because of all that 
walking, but when they were intimate, he’s taken notice that she was stronger than what 
he initially thought. 
“I swear this woman was made to ruin me.”, he muttered as he smelled her vest. 
He placed it on the bed and collected all other items that were clean to double check 
them. The things that were dirty were already waiting in the pile by the entrance flap to 
be washed later. So, he got his mending kit: needle, thread and some scraps in case he 
needed to make patches. 
This kind of busy work allowed him to focus and minimize his wandering mind, but 
today was not his lucky day. He had a lot of things on his mind, not just the areas of Tav
 he found alluring, Perhaps he was just hungry, or maybe he simply didn’t like to be 
away from her anymore.
 While on the bead, he saw the pumpkin looking back at him. He finally saw what she 
meant about ‘reminding her of him”, it did have a coy smile. He liked that she found his 
smile to be one of the many things she love about him. She shouldn’t in his opinion, but 
he had stopped trying to dazzle her long ago. It wasn’t necessary, just being present, or 
an accidental touch was enough for her to get giddy to this day. 
He remembered when she told him that in one of the many jobs they picked up for coin. 
“Why do you try to dazzle me with your sensual ways? It’s-… I don’t know-… I mean, 
if you need something, just ask. I’ll probably say yes, anyway.”
 He saw her turn around pretending to look at a wall that suddenly became the most 
interesting thing in the world.
 “Mh-… you’re no fun. But, very well. Tonight, would you care for a bit of fun?”
“Fun like fun? Or, fun like you want sex fun?”
 “Gods! Must you be so crass? Yes, sex, Tav. I’d like for you and I to have sex. Tonight. 
Your tent. Yes?”
 She forced herself to look at him before she gave an answer. 
“Yes. Tonight. Feed, too?”
 “What?! I mean-… well,… that is-…”
 “I have no issues with it. I want you-… I mean, you don’t have to if you don’t want to, 
but-… but if you need, we can.”
 Both, couldn’t help themselves, but they were starting to get embarrassed. Tav didn’t do 
well with flirting. She was very direct and practical back then and Astarion, despite 
seeing everything as transactional, he found her very peculiar. She clearly didn’t 
understand how people usually initiated intimacy. She was too direct. “Do you want 
sex? Yes. Me too. Let’s do sex.” It was horrible in his opinion, but he liked her 
company. She liked to copy his actions, too, so that made him enjoy himself more. 
Perhaps it wasn’t the best that he was teaching her his depravity, but he secretly thought 
she was just at bad, but was still honing her skills.
 But not all memories brought a smile to his face. The lingering conversation still 
loomed, and knowing her, she was not going to drop it. So, while he was working the 
needle and thread, he allowed the events of the tavern flood back in like an angry river. 
That wretched woman and her nosy disposition! I mean, sure right now I don’t have the 
economical means to buy a steady home, but I’m a traveling journey man. What use is a
 house to me, now. Besides, like Tav said, this is our home and together we’ve made this 
livable. Hell, it is more comfortable than what mine was before. Sure, I preferred hers 
back in the day, but to think of it, she would have let me be there without the fun. It 
doesn’t matter. As for children-… I mean-… would I-… could I? I can’t even remember 
my own parents now, and-… But, what if she wants them? I don’t want to rob her of the 
chance like I was. Perhaps, if-… Who am I kidding? That woman would never consider 
it. If it is not me, it’s not going to happen. I just don’t understand why she’s so-… 
giving. No one has a heart like hers. And out of all of us, she chose me! Why in the 
hells?! I was horrible with my game of seduction and now look at me, the house 
husband to a fiery fey.
 Something slithered outside and took him out of his trance and thoughts. His eyes 
snapped open, hand on his blade. It was just a snake slithering too close to the tent wall. 
Luckily, there had been no other things that could cause a bother. 
But in the distance, he heard rattling and perhaps kicking? He couldn’t open the flap to 
check yet. It was bright out. That just got him more annoyed. Then the noise stopped 
and he got nervous.
 “Tav, don’t scare me like that. Why did you stop moving?”, he said with a nervous 
glance at the entrance. 
The reason Tav had stopped was simple, she was picking up some grass. She was 
working on her little flowers non the wiser. Now, with little flowers on her hands, she 
was trying her best to push the cart and kick the log to get home faster. 
Then he heard the cart pick up speed again, and the kicking was now closer. 
“She’s almost home. Good. I was getting nervous.”
 But we know that is a lie. He was nervous for her safety. She practically went into 
enemy territory because he needed to do laundry. A mad woman, in his opinion, but 
thankful of her practicality. He wouldn’t have gone through all the trouble. 
“There’s home. I’m so close, and tired. I think I want to clean up and lay down for a bit, 
before I get to my fish. Or maybe the fish first then the rest-… I hate that plan. Fish 
first.”
 The minutes felt like decades the closer she got, but she got there. She got near the tent 
so he could hear her.
 “Astarion, I’m back. There is still a lot of light out. I need to do some work outside first. 
Try to calm your mind. It will be sunset before you know it.”
 Astarion was standing right at the flap, shoulders tense. As he heard her, he relaxed all 
the tension he had on his shoulders.
 “Fine. Welcome home, my dear.”
 “Thanks. And Astarion, I missed you. Here.”
 She stuck her hand inside with the saddest bouquet of flowers he’d ever seen. Yellow 
grass twisted into a ball trying its best to look like a rose and two yellow dandelions that 
were a little bent. His smile could light up the darkest reach of the Underdark. She 
usually gave him acts of service but this was her first thing she made. It was ugly and it 
smelled of dry grass and dandelions, but she thought of him when she made it with her 
hands. And all because she missed him. They were 10 minutes away if running. They 
were surely insufferable.
 “Thank you, my love. It’s beautiful.”, he told her as he leaned in to kiss her hand. 
She blushed. “I’ll be inside as soon as I can.”
 Tav began busying her self with the fish. She had a knife on her and used that to remove 
the fish scales. They began to fall in a little pile at her feet. The fish smell now very 
obvious, after all she had bought about 2 kilos worth of it. It would have been more, but 
now they had no guts. 
I got lucky. I don’t want to fight Gnols tonight because of my 
food. Maybe Astarion needs one, though.
 Astarion tried his best not to burst out of that tent, but at least she was outside. 
“Beloved, can you leave the green pack near the flap, please? I need some things.”
 “It’s there.”
 “Thanks.”
 Her hand reached in and took it, as he made sure to step back just in case light got in.
 “What are you doing?”
 “Well, have I got a story for you. I had an unexpected purchase and I’m cleaning it 
before it spoils.”
 “Is what I smell anything to do with it?”, he asked while making a face in disgust.
 “It is. Two kilos worth of it. I am descaling it. I will dry it. I am not a fan of it either, but
 food is food.”
 “Indeed. Food is food for you.”, he rolled his eyes.
 “Of course. On the bright side, I don’t have to worry about food for a while. The 
downside, it’s fish.”
She giggled at this. Neither were very fond of fish, but it was a blessing to have food 
without the hard work of catching it, or gutting it. So, for the next 30 minutes, he 
brooded inside as he paced like a poor trapped lion, as she worked as fast as she could 
removing the scales into a little pile.
 “There! Done! The sun is still out, but it won’t be long until the sun sets. Hang in there, 
sweetie. It’s almost over. Now, I just have to salt it and-… Let’s see-…”
 She decided to tie the burlap sack from the tightening rope of the tent to the side of the 
cart. This made a sort of makeshift table where she placed the now salted fish. She’d 
leave it here for it to start drying. She added an extra layer of salt for good measure. 
She smugly looked at her mess and said, “There we are. I think it will hold.”
 Then she finally headed inside with caution. She was exhausted and thus clumsy. 
“I’m going in. Stand back, please.”
 First she grabbed one of the water skins from the cart. For now, she’d keep the rest of 
the water to counter balance the fish. She wanted the sun to do it’s job. Then she would 
smoke it on the fire. Finally she took off her messy boots and left them a little to the side
 of the entrance. She’d do those later. Now barefoot, she brushed one foot on her 
opposite leg and stepped in, then did the same for the other. She stood there for a bit to 
find him. He looked like she thought he would, stressed.
 “Hey, my love. I just need to wash up. Give me a minute. But can you put this in there, 
please?”
She handed him the water skin with a smile. His eyes showed longing, but he did as 
requested. She felt dirty and smelly and she would not accept his touch. He had to wait 
until she felt decent. So, he stepped in the tent for now the sun was on the other side and 
no light could affect him. He just closed that flap to keep the breeze from coming in. 
While he was in there, she saw the pile of dirty clothes and simple stripped down to 
nothing. So, when Astarion came back into the main tent, he looked up and was 
shocked. His beautiful naked woman was walking towards him. 
“I’ll wash that later.”
 “Uh-… of course. Later.”, he managed to stammer. 
You can’t do this to me woman. You smell of fish, but-…No, it’s too much 
even for me. I’ll wait.
 He instead decided to sit down on the bed and wait for her to come out. Poor Rupert. All
 he’s done today, during daytime, is do nothing but wait. 
Tav took this time to not just wash up, but to think on how to, like we said, bury that 
hatchet. She was tired, and annoyed and didn’t want to give this topic anymore time to 
keep festering in her head. She figured it would be worse for Astarion. 
Should I tell him what happened or just finish our talk? I mean, they are 
connected, so… But, mmm-, let’s see, how do I start? Parhaps-… I have an idea.
 She let her ideas merge back and forth as she cleaned up. She had poured some water in 
the small basin she usually kept in the pack, which was a bag of holding. It was still 
curious witch craft for her, but She thought it hilarious when Gale almost ate it. Lae’Zel 
gave him a look. But Tav gave him some gloves instead. She thought he probably likes 
the leather taste. It wasn’t very good, but we all have our preferences. She loves a 
vampire, Gale eats leather gloves, and Lae’Zel likes to give mean looks.
 She used the a new washcloth that he had left her just like the basin. She added the soap 
to her wet washcloth and began with her face, then a little more water and continue 
down her body. She tried her best to not finish up the water now, for she wasn’t in the 
mood to go again for more tonight.
 As she was almost done, she poured the remaining soapy water on her head to quickly 
scrub her hair. With soapy eyes, she tried to get more water to rinse off, she almost 
slipped, but was able to finish up.
 “Oh, I forgot the towel again.”
 As Astarion heard that he stood up and was heading to the packs to get her one, she 
stepped out of the tent soaking wet. She took a deep breath and exhaled while looking at 
the floor. Astarion heard her but was still focusing more on getting her the towel. She 
looked up to see him.
 “Astarion? Look at me.”, she said with a quiet determination.
 It was time.
 “Tav? Is everything all right?”, he said quizzically. 
Deep inside he knew it was time, but he didn’t think she would do so now. She was 
exhausted.
“Maybe-… Look at me. See this? I told you about my branding before. Do you-… Do 
you remember what I said about-… this-… mark?”
 It was difficult to keep her emotions in check. She didn’t want to cry. Not yet. She 
needed to be clear with her thoughts and emotions.
 “Uh-… yes. It carries a lot of-… Yes, I remember.”
 “I don’t know what it has done to me physically. I was not there long enough to learn 
about it, but when I touch it-… when I touch it it burns, but not on my skin. It-… It 
burns deeper inside me.”
 As she said this, a tear rolled down. She was afraid to confront this truth she kept from 
herself for years.
 “Oh, that’s-…”, he moved to comfort her.
 He hugged her wet body and kissed the top of her head. Then he let go and stepped back
 to look at her once more.
 She looked at the floor and with a faint whisper, she revealed a truth that scared her.
 “I have not bled since.”
 As his mind raced to remember that night when she revealed her past to him back in the 
woods, his face revealed his shock and sadness. He fell to his knees and reached to hug 
her stomach. His cool skin made her give a little jump, but she didn’t step back.
“Oh, my Tav. Were you robbed, too? I’m so sorry.”
 Her hands went to his head and she began to run her fingers through his hair.
 “I don’t know for sure, but I’ve always felt that it wasn’t normal. But, who could I go to
… how can I check if-… I didn’t know. I still don’t know.”
 He turned his head up to see her. His sadness was clear. They had gone through so much
 alone and with each other and now, his inadequacies he’d been feeling started to feel 
irrelevant. She was broken like he was. 
“Astarion, I know you haven’t been out of that demon’s hold for very long. I understand 
that you will struggle with your own self because of it for who knows how long. But I 
need you to understand that I don’t see the truth in the brand he left you. Your scars will 
forever be part of you, both the ones on your skin and the ones inside. I know, because I 
have my own.”
 He hugged her again to no see her. He didn’t want to hear it. He was scared to admit it. 
But she always knew how to be direct and blunt about the things she saw. She always 
chose truth, even when it hurt.
 “I have to come clean. I really hate when you continue to choose to hate yourself. You 
hate the man I love. You hate the man I want to be with-… the man I choose to be with. 
It hurts me when you doubt yourself because you also doubt me. That hurts me, but I 
understand why you do it.”
 He squeezed her a little tighter. He didn’t want to listen, but the bandage had to be 
ripped out in one go. He had no choice now.
“You have been free for such a short time and I know it is frightening to learn to be 
again. Especially you. I was lucky. I was a child, but you were consious of your torment 
for centuries. That’s why it hurts me because I can’t get mad at you for not believing 
your worth. But, I do and I’m so sorry.”
 “Oh, Tav! You don't-…”
 “I do. I know sometimes I am not patient. I know that I am quick to anger. I know that 
part of that is because of my father and my clan’s doing. I came from rot and that is in 
me forever. My anger is part of it. That’s why I am convinced that you can come from it 
but choose to do better, be better.”
 She took another deep breath; she had to get it all out before this day was done. They 
both did for they knew distractions tomorrow night will result in death for either or both.
 Today was all or nothing. 
“I try my best to allow you to choose and I hope to the gods that you choose me, too. 
But, it gets exhausting that I am afraid you will let him win. That you will break your 
resolve and I wake up one day and I will be alone. Without you-… without you, I’m 
nothing. I don’t want it. If It’s not with you, I choose not to be anymore. To me you are 
my light in my world of darkness. Astarion, I love you more than I love my fun. I love 
you more than my wish to erase my rot. I don’t want to be with anyone else. I want you 
and you alone. I know I’m selfish but I told you once before, and I tell you again, I still 
feel that energy, I still feel my stomach go crazy, I still feel like you are the missing 
piece I didn’t know I was missing. I don’t know how it happened and I still don’t, but 
my soul needs you to find peace. My chaos inside calms down when you’re around. I 
don’t want to go back into the darkness, I will fade and I’m terrified to face away 
because you’re gone.”
She was done. She wept. He stood up and held her tightly, letting her head rest on his 
chest. He felt her hot tears run down his chest in a way cleansing him from the poison 
Cazador had fed him for so long. As he held her fearing that she would disappear, he 
remembered what she told him many moons ago.
 The night was calm and everyone else had gone to sleep. It was just them two sitting at 
the camp fire sitting in silence. She was lost in thought observing the flames, but 
occasionally she would give a light smile at no one. As he stole some glances to look at 
her, his mind wandered.
 You’re not a victim and you’re not a target, so what ever in the world could you be?
 She saw him looking at her with eyes full of longing. 
“Astarion? Are you alright?”
 “Huh? Yes-… No,-… I don’t know.”
 “Oh. Would you like me to go and leave you be?
 “No, please. Stay. I want you-… I want you to stay.”
 “I want to stay too, with you.”
 “Thank you-… Tav?”
 “Yes?”
 “What-…”
 He turned his face away from her. He was embarrassed to ask, but he needed to know. 
“What do you think about me? How do you feel about me?”
The question startled her. She was expecting anything but this. She hadn’t really thought
 about it before, she just did.
 “Well, that is a loaded question-… questions. I don’t know-… I mean, let me think 
about the proper words.”, she quickly said when she saw how he recoiled as she said she
 didn’t know.
 “Well, there are a lot of things I like about you. I think you are very smart. I have 
learned a lot from you, especially how to talk to people. You are very un-apologetically 
you, and I love that. I know that I talk like an idiot sometimes, so I like how you move 
about. What else? I like your sense of humor and when you lose control when you laugh.
 I enjoy your mischievous laughter when you are about to do something bad.”
 She laughed at this for she too had a dark sense of humor.
 “I like when you help me with things like how to throw daggers and when you help me 
understand what some books say. That’s very nice of you. I really like when you tell me 
your funny phrases to get me to notice you. I always notice you, so there’s no need, but I
 think you like to talk like that, so I don’t mind. It’s just a little confusing sometimes and 
then I clarify and you give me a sour look.”
 Then her cheeks flushed red and she looked at the fire instead. She continued. 
“The thing is that-… I don’t know how this happened. I never felt this before, but I don’t
 feel this for anyone else. Not Gale, not Wyll or even Halsin. They sometimes look at me 
the same way you do. I don’t mind it, but with you it’s always been different. You ever 
feel that energy if you get a really thick coat and you rub it on your body. You have that 
zap of energy when you touch something else. That’s what I feel with you. When I look 
at you or when I find that you are looking at me, I feel this energy jump in my heart, and
my stomach. I like it. When you are near me, I feel a tingle on the back of my head, like 
I’m dizzy, but I’m not. I-… I feel like-… like I was missing something and I didn’t 
know it. But then, I met you and I found it. I like how that makes me feel. I’m sorry. 
That’s selfish, but it’s true. You don’t have to do anything and I just feel at peace to 
know you are here-… with me, even if we aren’t together. But to know that you are here
 and you are safe, it calms my heart. Like my heart was working at half capacity, but now
 it’s working at full capacity because it thinks of you. I don’t know. It’s stupid, I guess.”
 She then looked at him in a panic moving her head and arms to show her negation.
 “I mean, I’m not asking you for anything. I just feel happy that you are here and that I 
have the chance to be here, too. I don’t want to imagine what will happened when we 
are done with the parasites and I have to go back the any woods alone.”
 It was a lot for him to take in. He was expecting, hoping even that she would say she 
liked his body or hair, but this girl, this impossible girl poured out her soul to him. Him! 
The man that became her first intimacy for personal gain and protection, was now the 
reason for this girl to not want to go back to her old life. 
He looked at her with a bit of a shocked expression, then his eyes softened. 
“You have no idea how much I needed to hear that, Tav.”
 He stood up and walked to her. Then he sat beside her and took her hand. They just sat 
down for a little longer in silence. He felt the same about her, but at that time, he wasn’t 
ready to admit it. But today we was.
 Back at the tent, he let go of her and turned to get her a towel. He helped her put it over 
her body, and led her to sit on the bed. They sat together in silence for a bit. 
Then he found the courage to continue the conversation.
 “Tav, time ago, I asked you what you liked about me, what you thought of me. You 
gave me an answer I was not able to understand then, but I think I am ready now.”
 She looked at him with sad eyes but an honest smile. He smiled at her and began to give 
her the answer she had been waiting for.
 “This is not easy for me. Give me a minute. I love your resilience. I love the passion 
with which you defend anyone, and everyone, especially me-… from myself. I love how
 you smile when you sleep. I love your scent of wild flowers and earth after rain. I love 
that you are clever and find ways to complete a task despite the set backs and you do it 
with an honest, friendly smile. I love the wild fierce look you have about you like the 
untamed wilderness that raised you.  I love that you don’t laugh, but cackle as if you 
allowed your soul to release your happiness. I love that you don’t force me to choose 
you and do what you want me to do. All my life, I had nothing, no choice, but then here 
comes you, begging in silence, so I would choose you, but then you do so many 
impossible things for me and I choose you day after day, too. Perhaps I am selfish, too. I
 mean, I get to live through you. The way you are so human without caring about other’s 
opinions. I love how life is exciting with you around. I love that you inspire me to 
choose to be me, who ever that may be, but that you don’t push. You let me flow at my 
own pace, despite my set backs. I love you. You did allow me the space to figure out 
who I am and what I want. After all this time, I realize that I do want you. You had been 
by my side through all of that and even through all of this, and you keep choosing to do 
so. You’re still patient. You still care. You continue to trust me and that hasn’t stopped 
being an objectively stupid thing to do. Before I felt safe with you, but now I know that I
am safe with you and because of you, even from myself and my past. I feel seen. I don’t 
want to lose that. You told me then that whatever may come, you got me. And you still 
do! Gods, you still do! Thank you. I told you that I had been dead in the ground long 
enough. That I’d try living again, but I haven’t, have I? I’m sorry.  I love this home 
we’ve made for ourselves in the middle of peril. I still want it all-… with you. You still 
see something in me. Someone else I can be. Someone that can break that cycle of 
power and terror that started centuries ago. You saved me back there and you continue 
to save me now. I really appreciate that. You’ve believed in me. Believed I was enough. 
That I am enough just the way I am. You have fought me to save me from myself. Even 
when I lose control. I understand that I am free and that you help with that despite my 
cursed circumstance. This is a gift. You are my gift. I too feel that jolt of energy when I 
look at you, when I see you, when I smell you. You complete that side of me that was 
empty. I guess it was empty because I was also waiting for you and I didn’t know it.”
 “Astarion.”, his name escaped her lips as she saw him struggle coming to terms with his 
own truth. 
“Tav, I know I’m not easy to love. But, I ask you to keep giving a chance to prove to 
myself that I am worthy of being loved, of being seen, of taking up space. That’s what 
I’ve learned from you. I am enough and I am loved. And perhaps, we may not be 
conventional in by any means, and we can’t have children, and I don’t have the coin to 
buy you a house, but, I want to be with you even if we have to live in a tree or a hole in 
the ground.”
 “Beloved, my Astarion, with you to hell and back. I would set the world ablaze if only to
 keep you warm. I need you here with me. Can you gift me that? Please?”
 “I won’t leave you, Tav. Not now, not ever. Now, I understand what you’ve meant 
before. There is no life after this, is there?”
 “No, I don’t think so. You are my life, Astarion. I love you.”
“I love you, Tav.”
 She leaned in to kiss him and pushed him on the bed, feeling free. Perhaps now, he 
would not forget again. He is worthy. He matters. He is loved by many and by no one 
more than her.
