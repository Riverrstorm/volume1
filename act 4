Chapter 18- The land down under
 Astarion returned almost tipsy. He got more than his fill tonight. Tav 
took notice. He wouldn’t be able to climb back up. 
Tav: “That idiot drank too much. He can’t climb.”
 Cal: “What?! We can’t open the gate at night, Tav!”
 Tav: “Don’t worry. Let mie see if I can help him up. Entretain him a 
minute or so.”
 Tav climbed down quickly to get some rope from her tent. Astarion 
was trying his best to climb up, but was very clumbsy. He was 
fooling no one. He needed help going up. He just giggled at his 
predicament. 
Astarion: “You wouldn’t know where the Tav is? I mean, the door?”
 Tav: “I’m here. Don’t move. I’m going down.”
 She moved swiftly. She tied the rope to part of the mechanism of the 
gate and the other end to her waist. Then she went down. It wasn’t 
too far down, but she prefered to do this than open the gate. The gate
 took longer to open and close. It would make lots of noise, too. 
Astarion: “My lover. Hello. You’re so beautiful.”
 Tav: “Hello, my love. You are, too. Let me just tie this around your
… there we go. Very well. I need you to climb up. I’ll help you.”
 Astarion: “Yes. Let’s.”
 It was a little difficult, but Tav was able to make him walk up the 
wall while using the rope as a harness on this legs and waist. She just
 had to ‘walk’ right behind him. The guards were waiting for him at 
the top, so as soon as they could grab him, they did. 
Astarion: “Thank you, fine gentlemen. The wife is behind me. Tav 
pays the tab.”
 He laughed at his bad pun. Tav just rolled her eyes at him.
 Tav: “Ignore him. He’s drunk. But thank you so much for your help. 
I’d give you coin, but I have none left. Sorry.”
 The guards just looked at each other a bit perplexed. These two were
 something else, and were quite frankly causing a stir in a good way. 
Most often they were on edge because to the outside threats, but to 
have these warriors here now and acting like stupid teens, was 
refreshing. 
Tav helped him down to their tent. By now, she had finished setting 
up their full camp set up with the permission of the druids, of course.
 She led Astarion into the side tent to get him cleaned up. 
Tav: “How many did you take down, love?”
 She said as she took off his bloodied shirt. She began to use a wash 
cloth to clean up his face, chest, and arms.
 Astarion: “It was 5. The ones I almost had before your whistle.”
 Tav: “Oh, then you are very welcome.”
 She laughed. She was off the hook in her mind. She made it up to 
him after all.
 Astarion: “Cheater, but I’ll accept it.”
 He tried to kiss her.
 Tav: “Ew. No. Wash your mouth first. You stink like wet dog.”
 Astarion : “No fun. But, fine.”
 He pouted his lips in annoyance. But, he did stink. So, he did as he 
was told. It didn’t take long before he was on the pelts trying to ride 
off his high. Tav just lay beside him tracing circles on his chest with 
her eyes closed. Tonight was done. He was too slugish to go tonight. 
But the bright side was that he wouldn’t need to feed for a while. 
She could just keep him topped of for a while longer as they set up 
camp down there. 
She hugged him and gave him a kiss on the side of his chest and 
snuggled to sleep. He was gone, too. 
Hours passed and when she least expected heavy footsteps woke her 
up. It was Halsin. As Astarion didn’t move, she decided to go and 
see what was going on.
 Tav: “Halsin. What’s going on? Everything all right?”
 Halsin: “Everything is all right. I just came here to invite you to 
breakfast. I’d invite Astarion, but I was told he had more than his fill
 last night. Hahahaha.”
 Tav: “He did. Let me just let him know I’m going. Give me a 
second.”
 She went back in, gave him a quick peck on the lips, and told him 
about heading back up with Halsin. He hugged her to trap her and 
laughed. Then let go.
 Astarion: “Enjoy your meal, love. I’ll be waiting”
 Tav: “I love you, my beautiful. Be back in no time.”
She followed Halsin up to meet with others. Tav sort of felt that 
there was more to this meal sharing, but she was hungry. And the sun
 was getting brighter, too. She was going to have to do it alone.
 Okta: “Good morning, dear. How did you sleep?”
 Tav: “Very well, thank you. How about you?”
 Okta: “As good as these old bones let me.”
 Zevlor: “So, Tav, are you guys heading to the goblin camp tonight?”
 Tav: “Yes. The plan was last night, but Astarion couldn’t do it. 
Hehehe.”
 Okta move a little uncomfortably. Tav noticed. So, she brought it up.
 Nothing beats saying things with your whole chest. So, she did.
 Tav: “Look. I know how most if not all of you are very 
uncomfortable with the fact that Astarion is a vampire. But, please 
let me make a case for him. He is a vampire spawn. That means he 
was stolen by a full vampire and then forced into servitude for 200 
years. He didn’t choose to be turned into the supposed monster you 
are stuck on. He was alone in the hell that trapped him and no one 
helped or at least tried to help. By a horrible miracle he was able to 
escape his hell. That’s how I met him. Now, I will say it was not the 
best impression, but I got to know him. The man, and he’s got a 
heart of gold. Yes, he is considered a monster, but who here hasn’t 
been looked at with disdain for the simple fact of existing out there. 
Even me. People whispered ‘witch’ and ‘feral one’ and other names, 
some much worse. Astarion helped you once, even against his own 
nature, and he hurt none of you. Back then he was more capable of 
taking all of you out, but he chose not to. Instead, he chose to help in
 exchange for nothing but wine and a party he didn’t enjoy. Now, he 
is willing to help me with my insane plan. Besides, if anyone here is 
a monster, it is me. I am the one who chose to mate with a vampire. I
 am the one who can walk in the light and in darkness. If you want to 
be afraid of anyone, be afraid of me. He calms me. Halsin can tell 
you. I know he knows more than he leads on. So, I’m not 
threatening. I am stating facts. He is a man with a particular 
sickness. He cannot spread it. But if you want to fear someone, fear 
me. Whisper about me. Feel uncomfortable about me. I was raised to
 be a weapon. I have no  qualms about my skills. But I choose life. I 
choose love. I chose you lot and I want you all safe.”
 The Tieflings present and some Druids looked a little flustered but 
also a little ashamed. Their knowledge about vampires was being 
forced upon Astarion, while the one that would take them out was 
able to move about like it was nothing special. 
Zevlor: “I apologize Tav. You are right. He’s been nothing but a 
great help. And I agree. I’ve seen you fight.”
 She nodded her head in acceptance. By now, she had been served 
some food and was enjoying it. She loved free food. 
Halsin: “So, Tav what’s the plan exactly?”
 Tav: “Scouting first. Reconnaissance. We don’t know much about 
the land nor the whereabouts of the kin. Then camp out. Next plan 
the next phase. I don’t know that part. But the firt part is clear.”
 Zevlor: “Will you be needed help?”
 Tav: “What?! To go down there you mean? Oh, gods, no! I don’t 
even know what to expect. I mean, if you were offering. No, thank 
you. You’ll need all hands on deck up here. That is especially for 
those that want to keep moving to Baldur’s Gate. I would like to 
escort those who go or find an escort.”
 Zevlor: “Are you sure to just have you two go?”
 Tav: “Yes. The thing is that we are will be the most dangerous beings
 in those ruins. I need a full focus and Astarion and I have fought 
together long enough to know each other’s moves. We are basically 
a well-oiled war machine. It would take months to train your current 
soldiers to match me. Right now, they would not be of any help to 
me down there. But all the best help up here. They know the land up 
here. I’ll need their help when I come back up. I need an updated 
map for this land.”
 Rikka: “Oh! Perhaps I can help with that. I know the land pretty 
well.”
 Tav: “Would you?! Oh, that would be wonderful! Oh, but I do owe 
you coin for your service. I’m all out at the moment.”
 Tav gave an embarrased smile. Though she usually over paid for 
many things, she had given away all her coin. 
Rikka: “Don’t worry. You already gave us so much of it already.”
 Tav: “Well, I’ll make it up to you, either way. Thank you so much.”
 Tav finished eating and thank them all, then headed back down. She 
was feeling energetic and rather full. The food was good. It surely 
beat salted fish, so she wondered if she could do a trade up before 
they left. 
As she reached their tent, she saw him outside sitting on the grass 
under the shade with his eyes closed. A faint smile on his face. She 
could tel that he had noticed her already, which was the reason why 
she didn’t want soldiers now. They were very much in synch.
She then stopped walking and a wide grin appeared on her face. She 
began to slowly back away, while still looking at him. 
Astarion: “Just what in the hells are you doing, my love.”
 He said with an annoyed look. His faint smile gone, but his eyes still
 closed. Tav couldn’t control it, she started laughing out loud as she 
continued walking forward. Then she sat right in front of him.
 Tav: “Hi.”
 She said with a devilish grin.
 Astarion: “Funny.” 
He finally opened his eyes. Today they looked a pale pink. She 
noticed that the hungrier he got, the deeper in color they became. 
This was mostly from  her memories of his siblings when they tried 
to kidnap him and take him back to the demon.
 Tav: “So, how are we feeling today? Were you able to rest well? I 
did. I didn’t have any dreams good or bad.”
 Astarion: “Well, I think I will agree with you there. This place has its
 charm and benefits.”
Tav: “It does. I love it here. And it’s so close to the entrance. I’m so 
excited about the trip. I can’t help it. I know it will be a challenge, 
but I don’t know-… I feel it in my gut.”
 Astarion: “Your gut? Or it can be the food you ate. Are you sure it 
wasn’t poisened?”
 Tav: “You tell me. You hungry?”
 She teased while showing her neck. This was part of the reason they 
got along so well from the start. She could take it as well as she 
could dish it out. Even when he had a blade to her neck, she didn’t 
feel in danger. Animals in the wild will always show teeth first. And 
those who will attack don’t use theatrics. They just bite. In other 
words, Tav let him play his games because she was entertained. He 
barks. She bites. 
Astarion: “So, are we leaving tonight? I saw you packed last night. I 
apologize. I seemed to have gotten carried away.”
 Tav: “Nah, don’t stress it. You have been looking out for me all this 
trip. It was only fair you got your chance to endulge and rest.”
 Astarion: “What on earth do you mean? I have been indulging.” 
He caressed her cheek. She blushed red and averted his eyes. He 
gave a little laugh. He loved it when he got her to blush still. 
Tav: “I know. But not like that.”
 She caught his hand and kissed it. Had he been able, he’d blushed, 
too. 
Tav: “I was remembering what the route was like to the goblin camp.
 Do you remember details? I have a bit of a blurr. I mean, I remember
 the party that night, but the details of the attack-… I just-… it’s 
vague.”
 Astarion: “Well, I’d expect it to be vague for you. You were a bit 
wilder then. You had a look in your eyes. Very cold, not you in a 
way, but it was you. Like a different side of you takes over. You were
 barking out orders and they landed with precision. Lae’Zel and Wyll 
were quite impressed you hadn’t been trained for battle. Then again, 
they didn’t know what I know now.”
 She felt a little ashamed and disgusted with this. This brought back 
the memories of the stolen childhood in her clan. They were very 
bad folk, children or not, they all had to endure to live.
 Her mind went back to one of the many training days. By now, she 
was 6 years old going into 7 years old. A year from now, she would 
have her first kill, a weak male cousin that couldn’t best her. That 
morning she had been woken up from the baracks. She was one of 
30 children ages 5 to 10. They were grouped with similar ages and 
sizes. The teens were now in another newer group. Due to her age, 
she was still not ready for breeding, so she had to be put with the 
male population per the established rules. 
They headed to the showers first, then to eat, and then to train. The 
first training was easy, they had to run for 30 minutes without 
stopping over dangeours terrain. That terrain being that the teens 
would shoot arrows at them if they moved too slowly. This taught 
them to be aware of their surroundings and how to dodge and hide. 
She thought it was stupid, but she had to do it anyway.
 Then they had to practice with blades, swords, daggers, throwing 
needles. This was not her favorite, but it was better than running and 
dodging arrows. She prefered the daggers, though. It was more 
intimate, but the way they had to learn how to wield them wasn’t. 
They would sometimes have a child practice their skills of survival 
and dual wielding by caging them with a predatory animal. Wolves, 
bears, mountain lions, whatever animal the insane adults could come
 up with, they would have a child with knives try to fight it off. 
She also thought that was stupid. She hated hurting the animals, but 
she understood that they were that day’s lunch or dinner. As she was 
rather nimble and flexible, she was able to use her surroundings to 
take a higher ground and ambush her prey. Then cut the hind legs. 
Then the side. Bleed the animal a little before jumping on top and 
slicing the throat open. She was thankful that the people observing 
never made a noise. This wasn’t a show to cheer for. This was just a 
regular Tuesday. 
Then shower again. Eat whatever was on the menu and head to the 
next stage, bow practice. This was gradual. They taught different 
aspects of how to use a bow properly, how to maintain it, how to 
craft it, how to consider your own body to craft it to your benefit, 
even how to make your own arrows. The training went fast, so she 
had to pay attention and review a lot. If it was detected that she was 
falling behind, the punishment could be a whiping or death. 
Accidents happened to those who failed to catch up. And for her, 
being the daughter of the Clan Chief meant she had not space for 
mistakes. Her mother and her would receive punishment for her 
failure. 
Then it was the theory classes. There she learned about organizing 
groups of fighters and reconnaissance, and planning. Basically, what 
Lae’Zel and Wyll were impressed about. She had also been trained, 
but she didn’t show it. The tests for this part of the training were the 
toughest, though. That was because it was combined with their 
ranger training. 
For the rainger training, they had to apply all they learned plus the 
extras. Climbing trees, making rope, finding good spots to spend the 
night. Basically, they would train the kids five days a week. Then 
two days, the would have to survive the forest alone. They were 
being hunted by other members of the clan while also needing to 
stay safe from whatever other danger would be lurking in the 
shadows of the forest. 
Tav had several close calls in her first expeditions alone, but got the 
hang of it soon enough. She didn’t want to die then, but she didn’t 
want to live that life of her people. 
Then, she turned 7. The training got more intense. This was the cut 
off for the ones who were strong enough to progress and those who 
were not worthy of carrying on the family blood line. Like cattle, 
only those with the best traits would be allowed to move forward. 
So, the day came that she had to participate in the battle. Everything 
they had learned to that point was to be used to make it out alive. 
She had been practicing for a year and she taught she was good 
enough to survive. But then, when she arrived at the field, she 
realized who she was paired against. It was the one she always tried 
to help. 
All of them were related, so he was one of many cousins. The 
problem was that she took a liking to him for he was not feral like 
the rest of them. Had he had the chance, he’d been a great scholar. 
Unfortunately, he too had been born in a den of monsters. 
She looked up to her father up at the platform with all the hatred she 
could muster at her young age. She knew this was his doing. 
Demons like him were always watching and he knew that she had 
been saving the poor kid countless times. But now, time ran out. She 
would have to decide if she lived or he. We know how that turned 
out.
 So, they rang the bell and the fight began. It was an obstacle course 
first. This time they had used hungry wolves. That was good for her. 
She was a good climber, but the kid wasn’t. She had to help him, 
only avoiding the inevitable. Tav begged him to not let go as she 
went back down to take out the wolves. The fist one closest to her 
nipped at her, but she jumped back and hit her head. She saw blurry. 
A branch cut her forehead and she was bleeding. The wolves went 
into a frenzy. She shouted at the boy to not let go. 
She ran to the opposite side to get them away in case he couldn’t 
hold on. She knew that some of their members were born frail, but it 
was more to do with inbreeding than anything. By then she had 
made that connection, so she took care of him because it wasn’t his 
fault. He was just unlucky.
 So, she found the hidden bow and arrows that she was supposed to 
find by the glint of it. She took it and the quiver and climbled a tree 
with a thin trunk. She used her legs to help herself stay on high 
ground. She was high enough that even the jumps of the animals 
didn’t reach.
 The she twisted her torso to try and hit at them. It wasn’t the best 
position, but she had little choice. She managed to hit 2 and as they 
went down, the other three began eating them. She used the 
distraction, to climb to the branch and swing away. The cousin was 
struggling more now, but with his leg pointed to a rock with a 
crevice. That’s where the other weapon was. She ran to get it and the
wolves took after her. It was a dagger. As soon as she grabbed it and 
turned around. The wolve had jumped at her. She felt how the dagger
 cut through the animal and then its blood ran down her hand. It felt 
with a thud. She slit its throat. You don’t move unless you make sure
 they stop moving. For us that means, “always double tap.” If you 
know, you know. 
As she was being circled by the last two, she finally saw the other 
dagger. She slowly went to get it. It was sticking out for the tree 
trunk. She grabbed it and used them to climb up the trunk. She 
needed time to breathe and think. She looked at the terrain and saw 
that she had to move fast or the boy would fall. Not that it would 
serve any purpose. But she couldn’t let him go yet.
 So, she took a risk. She threw the blade at the dog. It hit on the side. 
It yelped. As this happened, she had gone down the trunk and had 
already let go of the arrow to the other one. It hit on the head. It went
 down. Then she ran to the one with the dagger on its side and stuck it
 in more. With the same dagger, she took it out and stabbed its head. 
She was almost done. One enemy left. He was now standing in the 
center of the arena, their cage. She didn’t want to go, but he called 
her name. She looked up. She had no choice. She knew that if she 
refused to finish it, he would still die. They would also punish her by
 making her repeat the test with another and another. Her father knew
 she was capable. She was good stock in his eyes. All he had to do 
was wait for her first bleed to transition her like her mother before 
her. 
His booming voice called her name. She looked up at him with 
hatred. He reminded her of what she already knew. She had no 
choice.
 So, she walked slowly towards the boy. Short and frail with bronze 
skin, light brown hair, and the sweetest eyes. She was crying in 
silence. Her tears running down her face, falling on the floor even as 
if her tears where trying to wash away the sins of her people. She 
didn’t want to do it.
 She took her fighting stance and told him to do the same. She threw 
a dagger at his feet to give him the final aid, a weapon to defend 
himself. Then she wiped her tears, her face smeared with sweat, dirt, 
and blood. Her eyes burned and she could smell and taste the metalic
 flavor of blood. Some was hers, but most was from her kills. 
Then he launched at her. Bad posture. Bad form. He had no chance. 
She turned, evaded, stuck her leg between his as he ran towards her. 
He lost his balance. She grabbed his shirt to guide him where she 
needed him. He dropped his weapon. She still had hers. She pinned 
him down. 
It was time. He smiled at her as if forgiving her for what she was 
being forced to it. All of it. Then he spoke for the last time. 
Rikkon: “It’s fine. I’m free.”
 Her blade pierced through his little chest straight to his heart. And it 
was done. She closed his eyes. He still had a smile on his face. He 
was free and she was forever trapped in that hell. She cried. She 
couldn’t help as the waves of anger and grief washed over her. She 
failed in protecting him, but she succeded in her test. She would live 
another day. 
A guard had to kick her of his body as she dind’t want to let go. 
Then her father arrived and slapped her. She was showing weakness 
and making him look bad. She was whipped 10 times that night. She 
would keep surviving this hell until she turned 13 to then be 
banished from her clan.
 She came back to the present with Astarion before her, a worried 
look on his face.
 Astarion: “Tav? Oh, my love. Come back to me. There wasn’t much 
you could do then. As for the camp, I’m sure you are more capable 
of staying in the now.”Come here.” 
He leaned in to hug her, but he knew what memory popped up. 
Before, when they still had the parasite, he couldn’t help but reach 
for her mind and he saw it. Every thing that happened that day for 
her and her ward, Rikkon. She blamed herself to this day. In a way, 
he understood why she was the way she was. As well as why she 
fiercely protected those who she thought needed protection. Rikkon 
never left her and she never let him go. 
Tav: “I’m sorry. I just got lost a little, but I’m fine now.”
 Astarion: “No, my love. You’re not, but I have you now.”
 Tav: “Thank you. I love you my star, to the moon and back.”
 Astarion: I love you, too. Everyday a little more than before.”
