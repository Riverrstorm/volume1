CHAPTER 20 – Truths, Oaths, and Vows
 She let go of him and he stepped back. There were still tears on her 
face, but a new fire in her eyes, and perhaps her whole being. She 
stepped back on to the floor. She was determined to reclaim her 
power back. Dreaven Storm had claimed her truth long enough.
 Tav: “It’s time I get my name back, father.” -She whispered to 
herself, but Astarion heard it. 
He just waited. The ring box now safely back in his pocket. He 
simply looked at her to see what she would do next. 
Tav: “Astarion. I’m so sorry, but back in the woods I told you most 
of my truth. I was not ready to reclaim my whole self then, but my 
time has run out. No more running from my past, it seems.”
 She walked towards Selune’s statue with conviction and took his 
hand for him to follow her. She was still shaky, but was determined 
to lay herself bare. 
As she stood in front of the statue, she looked up and marveled at 
this diving being. Her soul recognized who she was and now she 
also knew her name. She laughed. 
Tav: “For years I was tormented by the very same who where 
supposed to protect me, to love me. They spat my name with disdain
 every time I refused to commit their crimes. They would whip me 
then use healing spells to not leave scars. We had to be ‘perfect’ for 
the men. It was vile. They would say my name like a curse wishing 
to one day have the permission to take my body. My tormentors 
taught me how to hunt, how to fight, how to kill, how to survive. 
And I got fucken good at it.”
 As she was speaking, she turned to Astarion, now standing in front 
of her. Still quiet, just taking it all in. He would not interrup her truth
 now. She has waited long enough.
 Tav: “My moon was my only and best companion. From my 
barracks to the trees I had to escape to, she was there. She lit the 
way, to safety and even to food. Since I was a babe, I followed her 
everywhere. She led me out of the clan’s forest grounds and into 
other lands far enough away. I always ran. I felt they were chasing 
me. Dreaven doesn’t loose easily and a banishing brand wouldn’t be 
something to stop him. He’d done it before. But he hasnt’ found me, 
yet.”
 She began to remove her boots and her socks.
 Tav: “When I was banished and kicked out, I was hunted. I became 
their test. They chased me for weeks. I wanted to die, but I couldn’t. 
I wasn’t going to give them the satisfaction to rid of me. So, when I 
was now alone, I lost my name. There was no one left to call me that
 name. There was no one. I was alone, abandoned, cast aside. I did 
everything they demanded, yet the one thing they couldn’t do was 
the reason to eliminate me. Monsters the lot of them, no better than 
the ones down there. At least those have a purpose.”
 Her anger was rising. It was a difficult mask to destroy. She removed
 her belt and little items and placed them on the floor. 
Tav: “So, for what seemed to be a long time, I didn’t speak. I just 
existed like one more animal in the forest. I began to lose myself. I 
was feral. I was wild. I chose to not be me anymore. I lost my 
name.”
She had to take a moment to compose herself. She closed her eyes 
and tilted her head back. She was fighting her grief. She was tired of 
crying. She wanted to purge the last remains of her father’s curse 
and he didn’t deserve her tears. 
Tav: “By the time I was 25, I had been out of the Great Wild Woods 
for some time. I had kept moving and eventually stopped at the 
Forest of Lethyr. There some settlements near that forest and I began
 to make products to trade with them. I didn’t need to, I wanted to 
have an excuse to go and learn about people. But it was so difficult. 
They saw me like some feral beast that was pretending to not be it. 
And I had no name to give. I didn’t want to give it. It was still 
tainted with the venom from home.”
 She sighed. Then she removed her pants, slowly. 
Tav: “I kept going back and forth with humans, trying to learn their 
ways, but it was so hard, you know. Their rules and their opinions 
that always contradict. Then the way they treated each other 
depending on how much gold they had. Once I was even kicked out 
of the town market because I scared the man in a dress! Me! Look at 
me! Am I frightening? Don’t answer that.”
He didn’t but he did smirk a little. She cold be a little scary 
especially if she was angry. She removed her top and her necklace 
that she was wearing as a bracelet. 
Tav: “I stopped going to that town. Then I went to the one beside it. 
Nyth, I think. That one was a little better. There were more people 
due to the rivers.”
 She gave a little jolt at that. Then she took a deep breath and 
continued.
 Tav: “By then, I had learned to sell pelts and poutices, and preserves.
 I had begun to buy clothes like theirs, too. It was a disguise I would 
use when I went to the town. Then one day, an old woman kept 
looking at me. All day she would just linger around. Until I was 
packing my things to head back to the forest that she decided to 
come to me. She told me that I reminded her of her daughter. She 
had been found drowned in the river when she was young. She never
 got closure. She offered me some tea at her home and told me about 
her girl. A fun girl, full of life. Her whole life cut short. I stayed with
 that woman for a week until her heart gave. She was lonely like me 
and she wanted not be. Her daughter’s name was Tav.”
Tav let a tear escape. That was one of few good memories she had 
before Astarion. 
Tav: “I promised Urith that I would honor her Tav by taking her 
name and living a long good life. She smiled at me and she closed 
her eyes. Then I went to the town cryier to announce her death. I 
never returned to that town for I knew they would blame me for the 
inevitable.”
 Then, Tav looked up at Selune and smiled. Her tears finally falling 
from the corners of her eyes. She took in a big breath.
 Tav: “Then one day, I woke up in a broken glass case. I was scared 
and all my stuff was gone. My weapons, my clothes, mememtos. All 
of it back at the forest. I didn’t know where I was. Then I met 
Lae’Zel. I had never met someone like her, but she was a soldier like
 I had been, so I followed her. I gave her Tav’s name. It was by 
mistake, but I didn’t have the heart to correct myself. I had promised
 Urith that Tav would live through me. So, I let her live, and what I 
life I gave her. But, it is time for Tav to go back to herself.”
 She removed her final clothes and now was bare. He couldn’t stop 
looking at her. All of this was a lot to take in. But he understood that 
this is something she would do. Give herself to others who were 
robbed, like he was. 
Astarion: “Then who are you?”
 He felt a pang of longing. He needed to know who was this woman 
who gave herself to him fully but now had no name.
 Tav: “The woman you have met. The woman you have travelled 
with. The woman you have learned to love. That is me. All of it has 
been me. The only thing that was not me has been the name I took to
 honor a dead girl who was stolen from a friend. I promised to give 
her a good life, and I did. But, now it is my turn to reclaim myself. I 
need to take back my name from the monster who gave it to me. It is
 time that my story belongs to me and to you, my lover.”
 She reached her hand out to take his hand. He seemed frozen in 
place. Then his legs began to move towards her. The closer he got to 
her, the stronger the pull he felt. His ears were crackling with static. 
He felt the energy like an aura that was either coming from her or the
 stature or both. Even his tongue felt electric. Once he was in front of 
her, she began to help him remove his clothes. Then he helped. He 
didn’t know why.
Now, the two naked bodies stood before Selune. Tav kissed him and 
held him. He did the same. Then she whispered to him “feed” and he
 bit her a second time. Two gulps. He then licked her wound. Now a 
little pink because it hadn’t had time to heal properly.
 He licked his lips. It was as if he was in a dream, but wasn’t sure if it
 was going to turn into a nightmare or not. She caressed his cheek 
with her warm hand then leaned in to kiss it. 
Tav: “Thank you for being patient. Today, I have to return to my 
body, fully return. I can no longer carry my past into the future we 
are working towards. You will need me fully. I have to let Tav go. I 
have to return and I am glad you are here with me to receive the 
woman I hid for so long.”
 She still had his hand on hers. Then she reached to touch the statue 
and finally the link was established. She felt now a burst of energy 
coursed through her body and made the hairs stand up. It didn’t hurt,
 but it was strong enough to make them glow for some seconds. Then
 she let go of the statue.
 Astarion was a bit shocked about what had just happened, but it was 
as if a burden had lifted from his heart. Like all lies he carried were 
now forgiven and left behind. His face showed a clear confusion as 
to what happened. But seeing her face, so full of love for him, made 
him be at peace.
 Then she spoke:
 “Astarion Ancunin. Look at me. I am not Tav of the Storm clan. She 
never was a Storm clan. She was human. I am not. I let her borrow 
me like a vessel to live the life that was stolen from her. She became 
me and I became her. But every single thing that I have lived, every 
moment of happiness I experienced, I shared it with her. I am the one
 who fell in love with you. I am the one that chose to be with you. I 
am the one who chose to be your protector, even from yourself. 
Though, I was weak. I didn’t want to let her go. I never thought that 
you wanted to marry, so I didn’t bother with letting her go. But, then 
you wanted to spend the rest of my days with you, and it all came 
crashing down. My time for running has come to an end. My time as 
Tav is also done.”
 She took both his hands and looked him straight in his eyes. She had 
never been as honest, as bare as now. She hoped to all the gods that 
he would still chose her. She took a deep breath and exhaled. 
She continued: 
“My name-… it’s-… River, from the Storm Clan. River Storm for 
short.”
 Astarion: “WHAT?! HAHAHAHAHA. A bloody River!”
 He steped forward to embrace her and he cried. The irony of this 
impossible woman. The very thing that she’s been working for him 
to not be hurt by in their journey. The very water that can so easily 
kill him. He had always thought of her like the fury of the oceans 
and now she reveals her true form. He cried in relief. 
Not only was she the light in this darkness, but now she was the river
 that would water the lands to have them grow. She cried with him. 
She was free. She was back. She was home.
 Astarion: “You mad, impossible, beautiful woman. Thank you for 
existing. Thank you for flowing into me like the fury only you could 
carry.”
 He lifted her to kiss her and she wrapped her legs around him.  She 
kissed him with a passion of someone no longer bound by chains. 
She was fully his now. And he was hers. Then he felt as his knees 
gave and they fell on top of their clothes. 
This reminded them of the cementery back at Baldur’s Gate. 
Astarion had his chance to be reborn. Now it was her turn. 
He claimed her as his own, but now it was as her true self. 
Their bodies were crackling with little burst of static electricity and 
they felt it, but it didn’t matter. He made love to his woman at the 
feet of Selune, her first protector. He vowed to protect her now and 
as he was making love to her, she vowed to protect him, his siblings 
and this land in the name and honor of Selune. As her thought came, 
a burst of light fell on them from the moon stone. 
River: “Feed, my love. Feed.”
 Astarion: “Gladly.”
 As he bit into her, while covered in the light that didn’t hurt them, as 
he was inside her, he felt how she tasted different. No longer was she
 earthy. She tasted like the forest, like the fresh air, and the trees, and 
like the rain. Perhaps it was the dead woman who gave her the 
earthy taste, but she was gone now. This River flowed into him and 
didn’t burn. He felt as if they were finally, trully one. He took a third
 gulp, and then let go. 
As he let go, they climaxed together once more and the light finally 
stopped shining on them. It never hurt. They were just two bodies, 
bare. She was panting, but smiling. He was smiling too and rolled 
over. Something poke him on the back. He reached over to get it. It 
was the box.
 Astarion: “River Storm, marry me.”
 River: “Yes, my love. I will. Let us be blessed here and now, and 
forever.”
 He took her ring and placed it on her left index finger. 
Astarion: “We have come a long way to get here. We have a long 
way to go, but now it’s official.” 
River took the ring for him and inspected it. It was quite lovely. She 
placed it on his left index finger. 
River: “Astarion Ancunin, I vow to protect you and love you and be 
there for you. I loved you then, I love you now, and I will love you 
forever and always.”
Then she kissed his ring hand and he did the same to her. It was 
done. From the Ravaged Beach to Cazador’s Palace, and now 
vowing to help his River build a safe haven for those like him at 
Selune’s feet. They both traveled through hell and back, but the 
journey was worth the prize. They were together as one. 
Now, River felt very tired as if all the energy and tingles had finally 
consumed her own reserves. Even Astarion felt a bit tired. 
Astarion: “Perhaps we should get dressed, wife of mine.”
 River blushed and giggled. But agreed. She stood up and grabbed 
her things and his and took off.
 River: “But not these. They are dusty.” 
She went to the room where the tables were. That would be the first 
place to fix up. 
River: “Can you go get the packs and bring them here, my husband.”
 She giggled at that. He smiled, but went. He felt a little strange 
walking naked like that, but it was fine. It wasn’t like some random 
stranger was watching him walk up the steps, get the packs, then 
walk down and go into their future kitchen, right?
He placed the packs on one of the tables and began to take out some 
clean clothes. Then got dressed with everything except weapons. 
Something told them that nothing would dare bother them at this 
place, their claimed home. 
River: “Right then. Let’s get dirty. I found some ancient brooms. I 
wonder how long for them to give. But, they’ll do for now. So, I was
 thinking we start here. Clean this up and have it be our base before 
we head out there and find the babes. We should scout this area 
around and remove whatever threats lurk around. Then fix up the 
upper area to have it ready for guests. I just saw that this wall has a 
portal, too. We have a lot of work to do.”
 Astarion: “Ugh. I’m already having to do husband work. I might not 
be able to help with all of it.”
 River: “Oh, shut up. Don’t be such a baby. How about we go fix the 
metal fence that is at the window to secure this place a bit more?”
 Astarion: “Fine. But, I will complain as I do it.”
 River: “And I will tease you as you do.”
 They headed back up to the now room on the right. River having 
grabbed her rope. He jumped down to tie the rope first and have her 
pull. He lifted the metal and together, they were able to lift it back up
 to cover the window. For now, it would remain in place with the 
rope, but they were going to see what else they had available. She 
felt safer already. 
Then Astarion looked at the fence that gave way to the Underdark. 
He saw that there were 2 statues that were the ones that shot 
anything that came near. He was warry of it. It was powerful magic. 
River: “It won’t hurt us. The beams of moonlight. It is not going to 
hurt us.”
 Astarion: “You seem so sure. What makes you say that?
 River: “Selune blessed us as we made love at her feet. We are to care
 for her home, out home, she wont’ hurt us.”
 Astarion: “But what about the spawn? We will need to deactivate it 
then.”
 River: “No, she won’t hurt us. My essense is part of you. Yours and 
theirs share a common link. You are the reason they will be safe. I 
am the reason you will be safe. We are all connected. She won’t hurt 
us.”
 Astarion: “What in the hells?”
 River: “Not the hells, but let me show you.”
She took off and wiggled herself through a broken wall and went 
around, barely missing the exploding fauna. Then she stood outside 
the gate, at a distance that the beams could hit her, but didn’t. 
River: “See, you wont’ hurt us. She chose us to take care of her 
temple. But we will start here, at the outpost. Then, with time and a 
lot of work, we will work our way up. It will be a safe haven for all, 
not just a weird place for weird scholars wearing dresses or weird 
folks reading books and only that.”
 Astarion: “Hahahaha. Don’t let Gale or Shadowheart hear you say 
that.”
 River: “Don’t tell them. I didn’t mean them. I like them. But, I mean 
it is a dress.”
 They both laughed as she scaled the rocks to climb back in. They 
were now having a fun time as they fixed up the place. After a 
couple of hours, Astarion had lit the fire place and Tav was heating 
up some food. 
Astarion: “So, I’ve been wondering, if you and Halsin are both 
wood-elves, why don’t you work with animals like he does?|
 River: “I don’t feel I should. I had to kill many when I was training 
and I don’t have the heart to team up. I prefer them to be wild. Free.
Also, he is a Beast Master. I am not. I am a hunter. Well, I am now. 
The Storm clan are Gloom Stalkers, but I think they took it too far. 
Bunch of wackos if you ask me.”
 Astarion: “Huh-… That explains so much. No wonder you have no 
qualms about being in the Underdark.”
 River: “I don’t fear the shadows. They made me. I fear not having 
you here with me though. I like having you around. Now, more so.”
 She stuck her hand out to marvel at her pretty ring. She loved it, but 
she loved the man who gave her the ring even more.
 River: “So, when did you buy them?”
 Astarion: “Elturel-… after we fought.”
 He looked a little ashamed. She stood up to hug him.
 River: “Thank you for listening. I think you have learned about love.
 And so much more. But now we will have to learn about running a 
settlement.”
 They both looked at each other. They knew that the next chapter in 
their lives would be challenging, but they were sure that with the 
help of their friends, and a little divine guidence, everything was 
going to be all right.
