Chapter 11
 With this ring, I thee wed?
 He was a sight to behold, with his gear, but it couldn‘t be helped. The tarp that Tav used back at 
Baldur’s Gate which she used to cover him under the cart was now charmed with Gale’s help. She had 
asked Gale to enchant it for emergency sake. After they finished the tent, she decided it would be better
 to fashion it into a hooded cloack instead, now that the tent was safe. She even dyed it a deep green and
 waterproofed it with bee’s wax. She said, “Now it can work to keep you sun-proof or dry.”
 He donned some special glasses with darkened glass. These were procured by Karlach when they were 
looting it. She figured they would be better kept by Astarion than to leave them there to burn. Wyll did 
the same. He found found gloves in some chest and thought they fit Astarion’s style. Gale checked the 
items and determined they were enchanted so the wearer could walk in direct sunlight for a very short 
while.
 He made sure as much of his body was covered to keep him safe for he was about to do something very
 stupid and without telling Tav. She was still asleep in bed and didn’t stir when he kissed her on the 
forehead before heading out.
 As he walked down the stairs, he caught the eye of the inn-keeper. The poor man gave dry gulp once he
 realized that mysterious tall figure was walking towards him. His only thought was that if the other one
 was with this one, this one might not be that bad, or dangerous.
 “Good afternoon. You seemed to have provide usefl help to my wife earlier. I was wondering if you’d 
extend the favor to me?”, Astarion said with his best velvety voice.
 The man was a bit shocked to have this otherwordly man speak to him, but to have him also have a 
voice that matches his face was a bit too much. He felt his throat dry in seconds. Astarion knew the 
type of reaction he was having on this man, and he relished it. He still had his charms after all.
“Y-… y-… Yes, certainly. How-… What can I do for you, Mr-… ?”
 “Ancunin. Mr. Ancunin. Well, you see, I am looking for directions to the best spots for trade, in 
particular where metals and gems can be bought, sold, or traded.”
 “W-… well, we have the high district. There you’ll find the best jewelers here in Elturel, b-.. but it is 
patrolled by the Kings Guard, so. . .”
 Astarion raised an eyebrows in surprise and interest. His bright ruby eyes almost gleaming in the dim 
lighting of the tavern’s bar.
 Giving him a knowing nod, Astarion continued, “ Clever man. But I thank you for the warning. I’d 
figured as much. Well, what would be the opposite side of that mess. I am not looking for trouble if I 
can help it.”
 “Well, we have the docks. Everyone who isn’t high born goes there. From tieflings, to traders, and 
everything in between. You could even sell your soul to the highest bidder before a paladin finds out.”
 The man surprised himself with how much truth he was revealing. He didn’t know it, but this was 
mostly because a vampire was charming the information out of him. Lucky for him, this one had 
already eaten hours earlier and the inn-keeper knew it.
 “Well, I thank you for your honest help, young man.”, Astarion wiked while pushing a gold coin 
towards the very confused, yet somewhat scared man.
 Astarion then put on his gloves and dark glasses, put the hood up, took a breath, and opened the door. 
He was nervous of the outcome, but he was determined to go outside. After all, he did need a bit of 
fresh air after his previous outburst. 
He wasn’t aware of it yet, but that woman from before really did a number on him. She hit him where it
 hurts, his pride. Despite the woman’s intention to hurt Tav for no real reason, she ended up getting 
under his skin, instead. She questioned his ability to impregnate his wife and provide a safe home. Two 
things that he couldn’t do no matter how much coin he could have, which right now wasn’t much. He 
was surely determined to “shut her up” one day, though. He may not be able to give Tav a child, but he 
will give her a castle, or perhaps a cottage. His “bog witch” will probably not be interested in a giant 
palace with an even larger service crew to maintain it. But she would like something more discrete 
inside or near a forest. 
As he stepped out of the inn, he tood cautious steps toward the street, checking his pain levels on his 
skin. As long as he felt nothing, the protection was holding up, but we wasn’t about to push his luck. 
He would move in the sunlight towards the shadows provided by the tall stone buildings and many 
alley ways. He felt lucky for that.
 As he walked, he saw a man pushing a cart and got his attetion. He still needed the direction towards 
the docks. He sort of smelled it from his current place, but he wanted to make sure. Mistakes and 
getting lost were not an option, especially in this city. At Baldur’s, he would likely be left alone, but he 
knew that this city was “too righteous for its own good” and wasn’t in the mood for taking on some 
religious freaks for the sake of being a vampire.
 The man pointed in the right direction, though he gave him an odd look. This tall man with velvety 
voice was a sight to behold; he looked ready to move in the shadows of a forest during heavy rain. The 
confused man simply thought it might be a ranger or druid lost.
 Astarion paid no mind and moved swiftly in the direction heading west, towards the docks. As he 
moved from shadow to shadow and occasional brigth light spot, he was caught in his thoughts again. 
He was replaying the conversations he’s recently had with Tav. He had the feeling when she woke up, 
all would be forgiven or at least forgotten, but he wanted to avoid the same rock twice. He didn’t want 
to find out just how much patience she had with him. He didn’t want to test it and find out she’s run 
out. 
He moved like a shadow and was mostly ignored the more he neared his destination. But his thoughts 
were still swirling.
 I would have never imagined she feels like she’s fighting Cazador, too. 
But, she’s right. He did such a number on me, that even now despite her 
best efforts, I can’t let go of what he taugh me. A whole lifetime of being 
called unfitting, unwanted, and unworthy can’t be erased in a couple of 
days, but I didn’t realize I wasn’t putting my best effort. Gods! She’s been 
putting in the work for both of us and not once has she reproached me 
about it, and what do I do? I do it for her. Idiot!
 He turned at one alley and saw a group of Kings Guard with ther armor shiny and clean. He simply 
hurried to the next one, luckily it was empty and walked faster until the end of it. As he reached the 
end, he saw that the next area he must pass had very little cover. He’d have to focus here to not linger 
for too long. Gale said he’s probably good for 5 minutes at most, but today wasn’t a day to test out 
theories.
 Astarion saw a horse cart moving along the direction he needed and this provided enough shade if he 
could catch it in time. He had to run just enough and keep up the pace. He managed to get next to it and
 kept moving. He was still safe for now. Fortunately, the sun was going down, so the sun was no longer 
right above him. 
Then he saw his objective, the river and the little shops, carts, and caravan. Many of them had put up 
shades for the comfort of the patrons. The smell of folks, the food, the sweat, the fish, all of it was a bit 
overwhelming, but he had his goal. He will get that ring and one for himself while he’s at it.
 But what is love? I’ve never had a reason to ask myself that, but she’s 
certain that I can learn. I swear she trusts me too much. Though, I’m 
lucky and grateful she does. After all, she was my first-… like I was her 
first. A blessing for both, indeed. Gifts? Is that love? Buying her things? 
No, that can’t be right. She doesn’t need much of anything that she hasn’t 
already got. Hells, that woman is capable of living in the woods all her 
life and never enter a city, so buying her anyting isn’t even something she 
requires. So, what does she mean by buying something just because? 
Holding the door open? A kiss on the cheek? 
As he entered the shade of the makeshift market place, he decided it was best to not 
remove his dark-glasses or cloak. He was surely causing a reaction as he was now to add 
to his situation. He definetly didn’t want to get the attetion of any pious guards which this
 city was known for, especially after recent events. 
He saw different folks with little tables full of items for cooking, for cleaning, for gardening, etc. He 
even saw the freckled young man with a “sick mother” now selling the items he traded with Tav for 
soap. Astarion found it a bit commical and decided not to confront the lier. She had accepted the trade 
as fair, so the boy was free to do what he willed with the items now. 
He kept moving until he saw that at a boat there was a stall with some chains, decorative daggers, and 
rings. He was worried about the water, but this was the first spot that had any sort of jewerly. So he 
didn’t have much choice at the moment.
 So far, what acts of love have I seen? Have I done? Is love a kindness? 
Who has ever loved me that wasn’t her?!
 As he was conflicted, he caught a glimpse of a mirror at a vendor’s stall. A small panic coursed through
 him, for it could blow his cover, so he moved away quickly enough to not draw any attention to 
himself. While moving, he finaly noticed his outfit. People mostly ignored him, so he was ignoring 
himself, too, until the mirror. He began thinking about how people perseved him right now. Today was 
a bright and sunny day, no clouds in sight. Then comes a tall figure dressed for heavy rain moving like 
a shadow through the shadows. A curious sight indeed. But his clothes right now weren’t common, 
even for him. His cloak was a gift from Gale and Tav. Then his dark glasses and gloves were provided 
by the ‘devils’, other ‘monsters’ like himself. They had no reason to even bother. They could have kept 
the items for themselves, but they didn’t. When had he ever given them anything other than some help 
during battles? 
Could it be-… that this is what she meant? They did this for me. This is 
the very tarp she used as she ran after me when I lost the parasite. She 
fixed the tent to be a save haven for me by taking her own belongings and 
combining them with mine. After she was exhausted from using her own 
essence, her magic, to keep me safe, she fashioned this cloak. She chooses
 me day and night, despite not being easy to love-… Is that what she 
means? Do I simply just do without expecting anything? But aren’t things 
supposed to be transactional?. . . But what do I give her? What have I 
given her other than my presence? She said she was selfish? How so? 
Every little thing she’s done for me was to keep me safe and happy?… It 
makes her happy to serve.
 He was so close to seeing her perspective.
 Meanwhile as he was on his journey to his own thoughts, she was having nightmares about themselves.
 After he left to go outside during the bright daylight, she began to see images of her beloved being 
chased by paladins and gur. She couldn’t protect him in the shadows and he just ran while she was 
useless. Then he had no choice but run into the light. She couldn’t reach him in time with her tarp. In 
seconds, his flesh began to bubble and sizzle. Then small patches of fire started on different parts of his
 body. By the time she arrived to his side, he had fallen to his knees as the fire consumed him. Her 
screams of anguish were what woke her.
 “Astarion!”
 She woke up covered in sweat and disoriented. She looked around the small room and realized she was 
alone. She called his name. Nothing. She decided to stand up and look outside the room. Nothing. She 
headed back inside and looked for his gear. She was terrified that he had simple left without saying a 
word. What this it? He finally broke and abandoned her like she feared? 
Where have you gone, love? It’s still light out? Could it be-…? We-… You 
can’t leave me like this, dammit! You just can’t-… 
She tried her best to control her emotions but she felt like she was suffocating. She double checked and 
his pack was still there, but his coin purse was gone. Her’s was still there, but-… Where was the cloak?
 She looked through his pack to find the glasses and gloves. Those were gone, too. She needed to calm 
down. She needed a clear head. So, she sat down, put her head between her legs and breathed. Inhale, 
exhale, inhale, exhale. Then she sat up straight and continued her controlled breathing while keeping 
her eyes shut. She didn’t want to cry and the lump in her throat made her very aware of her fears. 
Though she wasn’t sure if it was because of her dream or because of the fight they had had earlier.  
Either way, she needed to calm down before she made her next move. Minutes felt like eons for her 
right now, but it couldn’t be helped. She had to calm down. 
Once she was steady, she put on her shoes and headed downstairs. He was impossible to miss, so 
perhaps she might get some information. She felt like she was floating, barely existing. It was difficult 
to keep a cool head, but she had to try.
 “Hello again.”
 “Hello, Miss. Are you looking for your husband?”
 She was surprised which helped because it grounded her to the now.
 “Uh, yes. I took a nap and just woke up.”
 “Oh, well, he asked me about the shopping district. I told him he should try the docks. He left about an 
hour or so ago. He was dressed for the heaviest rain, yet it’s the sunniest day we’ve had for weeks!”
 The man still had a pretty happy disposition and didn’t push the obvious idea of the tall man he had 
aided. Everyone knew they weren’t simply some travelling merchants. They had the vibe of what they 
were, a vampire and if not a druid then certainly  some type of forest witch who claimed she was a 
ranger and merchant. The inn-keeper wasn’t about to question anything or anyone. He was just happy 
making coin and that these two ‘randos’ would be out of his hair by the end of the day. Hopefully, they 
would be gone way before any righteous nut job took notice and brought trouble to his business.
 “Oh, that’s a first! He usually hates shopping. I’m the one that ends up going, but then again I am the 
one selling my wares, so yeah. Well, I thank you, young man. I’ll just head back up and wait for him 
then.”
 The man thought it was curios how they kept calling him ‘young man’ for he was clearly older than 
either of them, or was he? It didn’t matter. He had patrons to attend and his new bear on the wall was 
causing quite a commotion still. He was already making stories about how it was aquired. No one 
needed to know that Astarion had actually fed on it some days ago, and that Tav worked her magic to 
release the lingering necrotic rot. Hell, she even left a strong blessing on it for good measure.
 While walking back she felt how the tears streamed down her face. He wasn’t gone, but why did he go 
to the market? What was going on? And at this time of day? Should she go find him? She worried that 
if she did, he might take it the wrong way? He did fight her about her being so caring? Could he be 
feeling that he was not man enough to take care of himself? Was that it? Was she babying her man? So, 
instead of spiraling like an idiot with questions she had no answers to, she did something better.
 “Karlach? Can you hear me? It’s me, ri-… Tav.”
 “Hello, Tav! What’s the news?!”
 “I was just missing my sister. I miss you so much.”
 “Oh, you’re just the sweetest, but-… wait a minute. You sound sad. What’s going on? Be honest.”
 A male voice could be heard in the background getting closer. 
“Is that Tav?”
 “It sure is Wyll. But something’s wrong.”
 “What?! What did he do?”
 “I don’t know. She’s about to tell us.”
 Tav gave a little laugh. She missed them both deeply and was sad she couldn’t go and help them over 
there, but she had a job to do here, even if her feelings complicated things.
 Tav: I’m fine. I swear. Well, fine enough.
 Karlach: That doesn’t sound fine enough to me. Spill it out, will ya.
 Wyll: Karlach’s right, Tav. You can trust us. We care as much for you as you do for us.
 Tav wasn’t expecting her friends to read her so well and she cried a little while she tried to speak. 
Tav: We had a stupid fight about Cazador-… again. And I’m afraid he will let that ghost win. I don’t 
know what to do. I do nice things for  him and  he’s unsure about them, but I can’t do anything else. I 
don’t know how. I don’t think I am his maid or servant. I do things for me, but now I just add him to 
the mix. I mean nothing bad by it. I swear!
 Wyll: Well, that does make it difficult. I mean, anyone else wouldn’t mind being taken care off like you
 do. I sure miss your cooking and the little things.
 Karlach: True. You were a riot and such a mom to us most of the time. I miss it. I mean, I am thankful 
and all that, but you sure were always doing things to help all of us, not just him.
Tav: I know! That’s what I was trying to tell him. I don’t do it because I will get something out of it. 
Well, I do, but that’s just happiness. I felt happy to give things to my friends. I don’t have a lot of 
money, so I couldn’t buy you blades, but I could buy flour and lard and I could pick berries. I made you
 things that I know how, but this idiot cannot eat. 
Both Wyll and Karlach laughed at this. For it was true, Tav did use food often for gifting, but Astarion 
was the only one that ate Tav and not her food.
 Wyll: I’m sorry, but he eats you instead.
 Tav laughed, too. Her heart was starting to calm down and her mind, too.
 Karlach: So, have you talked to him? I mean, do you know what’s going on in his head?
 Tav: Not entirely. He said some things, I reacted and sent it right back. I was so mad, but not at him. I 
know he’s hurting and that he is learning to be a person again. And I’m honored to be beside him in 
this, but I lost my temper. I was tired, I was hungry, and I shouted at him. I told him I was still fighting 
Cazador and that he wasn’t helping me fight him off.
 Wyll: Ouch. Yeah, that-… 
Tav: I know. I don’t know who hates that ghost more, but I lost it. And now he’s gone.
 Karlach and Wyll: WHAT?!
 Karlach: Where to? Did he just left whithout saying a word?!
 Wyll: No wonder you’re in such a state. Oh, Astarion now you’ve done it!
 Tav: No, well, I mean, yes, but not like that. I thought that too. The thing is that after we told each other
 off, I went to sleep. I needed a nap. He left when I was sleeping. But I was woken up.
 Karlach: What woke you up?
 Tav exhaled. Her heart was still not over the nightmare she just had.
 Tav: I was dreaming that he was being chased through alley ways and that I couldn’t reach him. Then 
he was chased out into the open street in broad daylight. And he burst into flames. By the time I got to 
him, I was too late. He was nothing but ashes.
 Wyll and Karlach: Shit! 
Wyll: No wonder you’re in that state. It wasn’t directly Astarion, but surely one of your biggest fears. 
Tav: Exactly. I spoke with the inn-keeper downstairs and he told me Astarion had asked about the 
market. 
Karlach: That’s strange. He was never the type to go anywhere unless is was a bar or a brothel. But to 
the market, alone? It’s not him. This does paint a better picture. 
Tav: I know. That’s why I am trying my best to calm down. He never made a mention of wanting to go 
to the market either. We arrived before sun up today, and not once did he say he wanted to go check it 
out or anything like that.
 As she spoke with her friends, she added more distractions to her mind. She took the opportunity to 
groom herselft. She wasn’t sure when she’d be able to have a calm moment to cut her nails and do 
other little things. So, she found her nail clippers and began to cut. Besides, she had turend her stone 
into a necklace, so she was hands free.
 Wyll: Well, I hope he wore his sunglasses and the gloves I have him.
 Karlach: Yeah, or he will be in big trouble. I don’t even want to think of it and I dind’t have the 
nightmare.
 Wyll: I agree. So, Tav did you check for his things? Are they still there?
 Tav: They are. His pack is here. He took his coin purse and all the gear to protect him from the sun, but 
I’m still worried. This town is nice and all, but-…
 Karlach: Where are you guys now? 
Tav: Elturel.
 Wyll: WHAT?! ELTUREL! Oh, Tav, you guys have to be very careful.
 Tav: Why do you think I’m such a mess? The inn we’re staying at right now is right on the edge. They 
know we shouldn’t be here, but gold does wonders. But, now he’s out there in some market doing I 
don’t know.
 Karlach: Oh, Tavy. I’m sure he’ll come back once he’s done what he got in his crazy little white head 
of his.
 Tav: I sure hope so, or I will burn this whole place down myself. I will finish what was started if I see 
one spec of singed cloth.
 Wyll: Now, now. Let’s calm down. I’m sure that won’t be necessary. I bet he’ll be perfectly fine. Just be
 a little more patient. 
Tav: You’re right, Wyll. Thank you. Well, my loves. I need to leave you now. I have to use the restroom
 and it’s outback of this building. I love you guys to bits and pieces.
 Wyll: We love you, too, Tav.
 Karlach: Oh, Tavy! I love you to the moon and back. Chin up, eh. Keep it together, soldier.
 Tav: I will do that. Thanks. Talk later. Bye.
 Karlach and Wyll: Bye, Tav.
 Tav dried her tears then walked to the wash basin for some water to wash her face. She grabbed the 
washcloth they had used and thought about it. She instead hugged it and placed it down and instead 
used the clean one. She headed out down the stairs and nodded to the “young man” before stepping out.
 As she went outside to use the restroom, she met with some Companion paladin coming right next to 
the building. Her stomach tightened. She felt the sort of danger this lot caused to those they didn’t 
deemed worthy, and she was most likey in that mixed group. Her face hardened to match theirs. Never 
had she felt taller than Astarion. She felt like a tight spring about to release, but she wouldn’t. Or better 
yet, she couldn’t, not now at least. She had a vampire spawn to protect and they weren’t attacking 
either, at least yet. 
The saw her with a face of disgust. Perhaps they smelled her scent, forest with undead. Or perhaps the 
fact that she wasn’t high born. She walked proud right beside them about to enter the little cabin with 
the restrooms and showers. That’s when one of them called her.
 “Hey, you! Wood-elf!”
 It took all her power not to shoot a needle at him. She took a deep breath and turned on her charm, or at
 least what she could manage for charm.
 “Yes, child. How may I help you?”
 He was taken aback and reached for his sword. She looked at him defiantly. She didn’t need to reach 
for anything. The needle was already in her hand. It would be lodged in his neck before they knew 
what happened and she’d be gone. But the other guard stopped him and spoke next.
 “You people better watch yourselves. Step one toe out of line and you’ll be in trouble.”
“Well, I’ll mind my manners as I take a shit, young friend. May I? Or do you need my assisstance for 
more show?”
 “No, carry on. But, we’ll be watching.”
 “I sure hope not, but then again, the divine loves to see wood-elves take a shit here. I’ll keep it in mind.
 Have the day you deserve, gentlemen. Now, if you’ll excuse me. I really must go.”
 The third guard couldn’t help but laugh. A short wood-elf had just told them off for keeping her from 
using the toilet. And all of this because their jumpy-er companion couldn’t do his job properly and 
loved pestering visitors. They then just kept walking. 
She finally breathed as they left. They put her in a jumpy mood, but she had to keep her head cool. 
Astarion wasn’t back just yet.
 By now Astarion had been to the little boat with some jewelry, but wasn’t convinced. He’d been to a 
second one and though they also had a good variety of items, nothing caught his eye. So he kept 
moving. The sun was now beginning too turn orange. That was her favorite color, he recalled. She just 
said one day that it made her happy.
 Mmm… I think I should get her something extra, too. I don’t think it’s the 
right time to propose, not after today’s fight. I’ll just keep a look out for 
something that she might like. Oh, there!
 He moved to a little stall where a tiefling couple was selling their wares and an orange something 
caught his attention. Once he arrived he saw that the orange thing he saw was actually a little pumpking
 plushy with an embroidered face; two large round eyes and a large toothy grin. Also, beside it was an 
owl-bear cub plushy. He was certain that she would love those. But then, the little box near them 
caught his eye, too.
 “Excuse me, I’m interested in the children’s toys you’ve got there.”
 The tieflings who had been chatting were startled by this tall figure covered from head to toe.
 “Pardon? The children’s toys? Are you sure? I mean, really? You don’t look the type-…”
His partner, the female hit him on the ribs with her elbow to shut him up. Astarion waited patiently, he 
didn’t want to cause a scene. Fortunately, the woman took over the conversation.
 “Excuse my husband. He didn’t mean anything by it. The toys are 5 sp a piece, but if you’re interested 
in both, I’ll take 8 sp for both.”
 “Mm, seems fair. Very well. I’ll take them. I’m sure my girlfriend will love having them on her bed.”
 The tiefling man raised his eyebrows. He was surprised that this mysterious stranger had a girlfriend 
and just bought two children’s toys. But, he was smart enough to keep his mouth shut this time. 
Then Astarion looked at the woman, tilting himself just enough so he could see her with his eyes, right 
above his glasses. She gave a little jolt, but tried to remain calm.
 “By the way, I’ve been looking for a jeweler or any place to buy a ring or set of rings. Would you 
happen to sell or know of a place where to-…”
 “Oh! You want your girlfriend to be your wife! How wonderful!”, the woman exclaimed with 
happiness.
 Now it was him who was startled. He was sure these folks saw the monster in him. Surely, he wasn’t 
marriage material, but despite his current garb.
 “Well, if you must know, yes. I am planning on proposing-… soon.”
 Now the man spoke. Well, that little blue box has a set of rings. They are a matching set. Perhaps that 
could interest you?”, he said a little nervously.
 Astarion took the box from the table and opened the box. 
He saw two rings, they were silver and black in color. The band for the female was not too intricate nor
 very plain. It had a design that reminded him of vynes, but there was an onyx gemstone right in the 
middle and it was big. On the side of the onyx there were two small red rubies, one on each side. As for
 the male’s ring there was a bit more of an intricate desing. It had an inlay that was meant to mimic a 
shooting star. Where the star was, there was a champagne color moissanite.
 He tried on the man’s band on his ring finger and what do you know. It fits. Then he tried on the 
woman’s band on his pinky finger. There was a moment he remembered when Tav grabbed his hand to 
measure their hands. He thought she was just finding an excuse to touch him, but luckily, it gave him 
her ring size. It fit, too. 
“Oh, will you look at that.”
 As he returned the rings back into the box, he finally paid attention to the top of the little blue box. 
There was an owl etched into it and on the side of it you had a repeated pattern of Selune’s symbol. 
Astarion rolled his eyes in annoyance, because he was too stubborn to accept this was meant for him.
 “Seriously?! Fine. I’ll take the bait.”
 He turned to look at the merchants.
 “And what about this box with rings?”
 “That’s a set. They go together.”
 “Of course, they go together. I’m asking how much for both and the box.”
 He was starting to get annoyed, but was trying his best to keep his cool. 
“They are 20 gp each so that makes 40 gp. I’ll through in the box for free.”
 “So, 40 gp for the box of rings and 8 sp for the toys. That makes-…”
 He decided to not bother with the money. He just took 50 gp and handed it over to the woman.
 “Keep the change. And if anyone asks, you never saw me.”
“What?! Oh, thank you sir. May many blessings reach you and your soon-to-be wife.”, said the woman 
as her husband handed Astarion a paper bag with the two toys. Astaroin had already stached the box 
inside his pant’s pocket. He thanked them and left.
 I’m starting to suspect interference here. But, I still need to go to one 
more spot.
 He went back to the first jeweler, the one in the boat. He had seen that this one had some 
tools to engrave rings. He reached this one while taking care of not standing in front of 
the mirror. He was almost done with his quest and didn’t want to ruin it by causing a stir. 
So far the pious ones were none the wiser about the presence of a vampire in their 
beloved city and he wanted to keep it that way.
 “Hello again. I was wondering if you offer engravings?”
 The man looked up from his book. His eyebrows raised in surprise, for he was sure he wouldn’t see this
 one mysterious stranger again, yet here he was.
 “You found something you like after all. Well, I charge 5 gp per phrase of 3 to 5 words. Had you 
bought it from me, I offered discounts.”
 “Not an issue. Your price seems fair. I’ve got two rings I’d like engraved.”
 “Very well, hand them over.”
 “First, I want this one to say ‘I chose you.’”, he said as he handed the man’s wedding band.
 The half-elf jeweler took it with care and examined it. 
“Mh, lucky man, you are. There’s seems to be something special about this one.”
 As he handed the jeweler the box with the woman’s righ he said, “So it seems. The second one will say 
‘You saved me.’”
 As the jeweler saw the box, he understood. He take extra care while engraving both rings in delicate 
Esprurar script. He did’t ask Astarion, but he took and educated guess. And Astarion didn’t bother in 
specifying anything as long as long as it was done with care.
The jeweler worked quickly and in less than 5 minutes all was done. He placed the rings in the box and 
closed it. 
“That’ll be 10 gp”, the man said as he outstretched his hand to receive payment. 
Astarion gave  him 15 gp instead. 
“Here you go. Keep the change. I’d appreciate if you forget I was ever here. Thank you for your work.”
 He took his box and placed it back in his pants’ pocket and headed back to his Tav. He took great care 
in not catching any more attention, espeically from the guards that were about to make their way into 
the market. He quickened his pace, back to the first dark alley.
 Back with Tav, she had since returned to the room and was now talkig to Gale while shaving her legs. 
She was now in a calmer mood, though she was still a little nervous. Astarion was still gone and it was 
starting to get dark. It would be a couple of hours until they had to leave the inn.
 “And how’s your mum, Gale? How is doing now that you work as a professor?”
 “Well, she’s doing fantastic, for the most part. I did move out, again. She wasn’t too happy about that 
but Tara has been keeping her company.”
 “Oh, my Tara! I miss her. She’s just the most perfect and bestest! Say hello to her for me. I swear, as 
soon as I can, I’ll ask Astarion to go with me to Waterdeep. I want to meet mum and scratch Miss 
Tara.”
 Gale laughed. This was the reason why Tara really took a liking to Tav. She treated her “like she was 
supposed to and more properly than most”, according to Tara that is.
 “Well, I’m sure they would both love that. I’ve chatted with mother and she can’t wait. And to be 
honest, she’s a little annoyed with me about you.”
 “Why? What did I do?”
 “Well, I may or may not have told her that a certain vampire-spawn caught your attention.”
They both laughed as they recalled that Gale and Astarion had a bit of a rivalry the first month that their
 party of misfits formed due to Tav. While both were flirty, Astarion started first. Gale always thought 
that if he hadn’t doubted himself, he’d been first. Then again Wyll said the same thing. But today, they 
were fine with the outcome. Tav was happy for the most part and surprisingly enough, to everyone’s 
shock, so was Astarion. 
“Oh, that! Well, tell her that I am stubborn and selfish. Maybe like that she won’t be mad at you.”
 “I have, but she doesn’t believe it.”
 “So, how’s our too pale elf doing? Is he with you right now?”, Gale said with a little panic in his voice.
 “No, he went to the market for god knows what. He’s been gone a while.”
 “I’m guessing he went with the protective gear?”
 “Yes. He took all of it and coin. He left his pack here, though.”
 “Are you doubting he won’t come back, Tav?”
 “I was a while ago. Oh, Gale! I’m scared. We had a fight before, then I went to sleep and I-.. I was still 
mad. What if someone tries to harm him and I was an idiot getting mad and-.. and-…”
 “Calm down, young miss. Relationships can be hard sometimes, but knowing you, I’m sure you’ll fix 
the situation if it was indeed broken.”
 “Thanks, Gale. I’m just nervous. Before I called you, I had gone outside and I almost got into a fight.”
 “Really? I thought you had gotten your anger under control by now?
 “Well, sort of. The thing is that one of those stupid guards wanted to start a fight because I’m a wood
elf. The idiot reached for his sword and everything.”
 “What?! Tell me everything and don’t skip anything.”
 “Well nothing terrible happened, really, but I was already not in my right mind. So, I went to the 
restroom and as I reached the entrance, I saw 3 goons. They were right next to the entrance, so I wasn’t 
about to run away. I paid for my services fair and square.”
 “I wouldn’t expect any less. So, they confronted you there?”
 “Yeah, the jumpy one wanted a fight, I guess. He was rude to me like he was trying to start a fight. But 
a second one told him to calm down.”
 “That’s good to know. We don’t want any unncessary quarels in-… where are you right now by the 
way?
 “Elturel.”
 “WHAT?! TAV! Why on goddess green earth would you consider that? Most folks there hate you and 
they certainly hate Astarion?”
“I know, I know. The thing is that I wanted to sell my pelts and wares, so I convinced Astarion. He 
knew about it, but he humoured me. To be honest, I’m conflicted as to regreting coming or not.”
 “Because of the fight?”
 “ Yes. It’s just that-… I feel I am now the one fighting Cazador’s ghost in him. He keeps doubting 
himself and whenver I’m not paying attention, I feel like he starts his pitty party of misery. That’s why 
I’m not mad at him entirely, but still, I was annoyed.”
 “Mh. I’m with you and with him. Though you knew he’d be a challenge, because of his past, that is.”
 “I know. It’s just that I would like to fight my enemies in the flesh, not the echoes etched in his skin. 
which reminds me, hows the favor going?”
 “I’m still searching. As soon as I have a breakthrough, I’ll let you know.”
 “Thanks, Gale. That means a lot.” 
“Though, getting back on topic, this means you’re almost there.”
 “Yeah. I’m anxious. If I find that we’ve lost a babe, I just can’t-…”
 “Well, you kew that was a possibility, givent the circumstances. Also, there wasn’t musch you could 
to.”
 “I know. I still hate the feeling. They deserve the world for they were stolen from it. I just want them to 
have the same chance to choose, to live, perhaps even to love. I want to be selfish and think that 
perhaps we are two pebbles in a lake and our ripple will touch more than the seven babes.”
 “And I wouldn’t expect any less from you. I am with you, though. Every step of the way.”
 “Thank you, Gale. I love you so much, and Tara. I know she’s listening.”
 “And pretending to be asleep by the window. And I love you, too, Tav. Both of you.”
 “Well, Gale. Thank you for taking the time. I’m sure you’re too busy, yet you made time.”
 “For you, any time, my dear. Besides, Tara would not allow me to ignore her favorite one.”
 They both laughed as Tara made a noise in agreement. 
“Talk to you later, Gale.”
 “Will do, Tav. Take care. And say hello to Astarion for me.”
 “Of course. Bye.”
 By the time she finished talking to Gale, she had shaven her legs, and cleaned her boots, as well as 
pack up their things. As she had done all of this, she hand’t noticed Astarion had arrived and had heard 
pretty much all the conversation. He didn’t want to interrup her call, but it had given him a lot to think 
about.
 I’ll just give her a moment to finish up then. But who is she talking to? 
Gale?! Perhaps I’ll just stay then. I wonder what he’s plotting.
 As he listened in to the conversation, his mind drifted back to his thoughts in the market. He was so 
close then, but perhaps he needed a little push.
 Acts of kindess? Not asking for things in return? Gift giving just because 
you feel like it? It doesn’t make any stupid sense?! None of it! I just don’t 
under-… 
Then he removed his sunglasses and his gloves. The same ones given to him by people who at first 
weren’t sure about him, would have killed him even. Wyll was certainly in that group to not give him a 
change due to his food preferences or in this case, necessity. Yet, they were there at the fall of Cazador. 
They didn’t asked for anything in return out of him. They simply tagged along because he and Tav 
were dead set on ending his reign once and for all. 
Then Tav told the group to take that which they needed, wanted, or even desired for there would be 
nothing left after that night. And she was not kidding. Once again, Astarion remembered her after he 
collected himself as Cazador’s body lay there. That was the first time Astarion saw hatred, raw and 
unfiltered in her eyes. She wasn’t a wreck like he was. She was determined. She was silent. He’d never 
seen her without her smile, even in her eyes. Those eyes weren’t hers, were they?
 Astarion, my love. I need you to get yourself together. We can’t stay here. 
It’s over. Come on. Halsin, help him up, please. There’s something I will 
do. As for the rest, as you leave, if there is anything you are taking, do so 
quickly. We dare not linger in this hellscape. Let’s go.
 As they started to move, Astarion looked back at her as she kneeled over Cazador’s dead 
body. She kneeled in his blood and whipered to him.
Into my fire, I’ll swallow your hate. You will not win. He is with me. I 
claim him for my own, Cazador Szarr.The hells will freeze before I let you 
win. I lay claim to him. You will be forgotten. I will set the world ablaze if 
only to keep my Astarion warm. Igne Furia.
 He finally was able to remember what happened after. That’s what she said, word for word.
 Oh! Tav! Even then, you weren’t ready to let me go. And the rest of the 
misfits?! They found the bounty and still thought of me when I wasn’t even
 thinking of myself. The gloves, the glasses, the cloak, even the tent?! She’s 
been letting me feed on her all this time. She even changed her diet for the
 idea that it matters? How in the hells?! Me? All for me? Is that what love 
is to her? I don’t-… But maybe I don’t have to understand. She said it 
herself, she does it because she wants to, not because she’s forced. She 
laid claim to me way before Cazador’s Palace. She’s been fighting him for
 my sake all this time just because-… Yet, she doesn’t want to possess me 
like he did. She let’s me choose and hopes to all the gods I choose to stay. 
I don’t make it easy for her, but she chooses me every day and every night.
 Has she thought of giving up on me? I wouln’d blame her, but then she 
does all of this-… 
Then he finally saw the paper bag on his lap. Two toy plushies without a purpose. 8 sp spent on added 
weight to their packs, bought because they would make her smile. An orange pumking with a devious 
smile like his and an owlbear cub because she missed owlbear. And then the rings. The realization 
washed over him like the strongest winter wind he’d ever encountered.
 Tav! You mad woman! You knew, you saw-… Gods! You beautifu wild 
beast of a woman! How can I-…? And you’re mine. I will choose you, too.
 Every morning and every night. You are mine, woman. I lay claim to all of
 you for you’ve been doing the same to me after all this time. And you’re 
right, I can’t let him win. He’s dead. He’s gone. I’m free-… I’m free to 
choose and woman, I choose you, too!
He stood up in one swift move and opened the door just as she stopped the connection with Gale. She 
looked startled while reaching for her dagger. Always the fighter, she had weapon at the ready. Then 
she realized who was looking right at her.
 “Astarion?!”
 “Tav! I choose you. Every morning and every night. It will always be  you.”
 “What?”
 “Doesn’t matter. Come here, woman.”
 He reached her in a breath and claimed his heart wich had been walking beside him all this time. He 
kissed her as if the world might stop if he didn’t. She kissed him back with the same passion. Their 
tears rolling down their cheeks as the relief washed over them. He was home.
Chapter 12
 Helen Wheels… and they’re never gonna take her away
 Once they both calmed down they were ready to start their chat. It was getting closer for them to head 
out, but there was still time to bury the hatchet.
 “You went to the market?”
 “I did.”
 “Without telling me.”
 “Correct.”
 “Why?”
 “You were sleeping.”
 “Miss me with the bullshit, Astarion. It’s a dangerous town for us. Why?”
 “I had to get some fresh air, and I didn’t want to wake you. I needed to clear my thoughts.”
 “Thank you. You good?”
 “I’m good. I swear. I’m better. I got you this.”
 He handed her the crumpled paper bag where you could only see an orange-… thing.
 “What’s this? You?”, she said with a surprised look on her face.
 “Yes, me! Woman. You’d think I was always against giving you anything.”, he said pretendeding to be 
hurt.
 “Well, you don’t. If anything, you give me a song and a dance when I give you anything, so-… yeah.”
 “Enough about me, open it. Go on, darling.”
 She gave him a suspicious look, before tearing open the bag to see what was inside.
 “AH! IT’S A PUMPKIN! AND AN OWLBEAR! They’re so cute! Mine?!”
 “Of course, my sweet. Anything for you.”, he said releived he got a better reaction than what he had 
anticipated. 
She walked towards him and gave him a tight hug. She was smiling from ear to ear. All worries and 
woes forgotten for now. Perhaps this was not the time to talk about what happened earlier today. 
“Oh, Astarion, I was so worried for your safety. I mean, there were some paladins that were-… but then
 they left, but-… I want to go now.”
 “I agree. I see that you’ve already packed up, so what’s keeping us here?
“Nothing. The sun has set. Let’s go before the paladins bring trouble to the young man.”
 He giggled but agreed with his head. By now, she had dumped the dirty water from the bucket under 
the water basin, made the bed and removed the leather straps from the window. Everything was left as 
it had been before their arrival. The only clue they had been there was the smudge on the floor from her
 charcoal. He goal was to not bring trouble to this business, so she did a quick blessing to try and mask 
any residual necrotic engergy left behind, especially on the bed.
 “Have I got the news for you, Astarion.”, she beamed up at him excitedly.
 He raised his eyebrows as he allowed her to pass through the door first. 
“I got my cart. It’s outside. It’s the best!”
 “Oh, dear! That excitement is beginning to worry me.”
 She pouted her lip in fake annoyance at him, but her eyes gave her away. She felt happy, and so did he. 
Both trying their best to not rock the boat lest they fall over again. They walked downstairs heading 
towards the inn-keeper. It was time to part ways.
 “Young man, thank you so much for such hospitality and help. May many blessing befall on you and 
yours.”, Tav said with a cheery mood and bright smile.
 “How much do we owe you?”, Astarion asked now free of his previous gear. This time the coming 
darkness of the surroundings was trully showing his real nature.
 The man gulped, trying to hide his fear.
 “Um, well, with everything consumed, and the room, you-… you’re pending 5 gp.”, he said while 
fearing for his life.
 Astarion reached into his pocket and gave the man double.
 “Here you go, and for your troubles. I’d ask that if anyone asked, you have no idea what they’re talking
 about.”
 The frightened man took the gold with a hand struggling to hide a shake, but agreed to the request. As 
this was happening, Tav had given a last blessing to the bear and to the establishment. She took a bow 
towards the man, and gave him another smile in gratitude.
 Astarion opened the door and allowed her to head out first. He followed and the door shut closed. The 
man was relieved they were finally gone for some paladins were indeed starting to poke their noses too 
close for comfort. He was hopeful that the witch’s blessing would be enough to keep her lover’s 
lingering energy hidden. Also, we was relieved that he found out Astarion’s nature now that he was 
gone. It’s not everyday that you house a vampire in the most anti-anything you can think of town. with 
any luck, those two would never return and carry whatever ill burden with back with them in case 
necessary.
 Lucky for him, he was safe from paladin questioning. They arrived at the Inn at night, when you would 
expect monsters to come out and play, of course. But by then, our unlikely duo was long gone and well 
enough away from this city surrounded in myth and magic, and heading into the woods, The Reaching 
Woods.
 “You’re going to hate her! I’m so excited!”
 “What? Hate who? Tav, what did you do?”
 “I bought my little wagon push cart, and I love her. I named her Helen.”
 As he turns from her and sees what she is looking at, he finally realizes what she meant.
 “I hate it.”
 She basically cackled. 
“I know! That’s why I love her. And they’re never going to take her away! Let’s go Helen.”
 He just rolled his eyes, but secretly he was liking the idea of not having to carry his pack with the tent. 
It weighed heavy on his shoulders. Besides, her happiness was keeping her from bringing up the 
previous fight. For now, he was happy about that too. 
“So, I’ll push her for a bit or pull her for a bit. Then when I get tired, you’re next.”
 “What? Why on earth would you ever think I’d touch that thing?”
 “Because you love me and because I said so.”
 Now the little cart was packed properly. With several leather straps she had in her own pack, she tied 
her iron pans and her little pot. She placed her cooking utencils on a sack along with the lid for her pans
 and pot, “just the one lid, because it fits the three”, she had told him when she packed them back when 
they first started travelling together. It seemed like forever, but now there wasn’t a parasite in their 
brain. 
Most items were water proofed, the tent, his cloack, the sacks. And inside the packs were the useful 
items that made their life possible a long with other things that made life bearable. She hung her water 
skins, too. So far she was working with 4: 2 large water skins made from the bears he’s killed and 2 
smaller ones she killed. Several meters of rope and leather straps of several sizes. 
They even had a pack with books and ink. The basically had a mobile home on their backs and now it 
was on this cart. And spearheading their journey, two plushies: a little pumpkin with a grimace and 
scowling eyes, like Astarion, and an owlbear cub. She loved them. 
“Let’s go!”
 And she took off running, her weapons jingling as she gained speed. She didn’t care for paladins, or 
nosy villagers. She only wanted to try our her little hell on wheels. Astarion just stared at her in awe. 
Lucky for me her stride isn’t wide or I’d be in trouble.
 He just quickened his pace to catch up to her which didn’t take too long. But, she was right, leaving 
that city quickly felt good. Their religious stuffiness and holier than thou energy was suffocating 
without realizing it. 
Once they were a little further away from the entrance to Elturel, she began to slow down. She was 
ready to check the map again, or better yet, have Astarion check them. She was never good with those 
things anyway. She’d send them to Avernus if he allowed her to lead the way. He thought it was 
curious how she could track almost anything, but a point on a map.
 “My beloved. My reason for being. My beautiful yet delicious partner in crime.”, she chimed trying to
 get into his good graces.
 “Just hand me the map, woman.”
 She laughed. He liked being praised, but she loved to mock him for it whenever she could. 
“Well, this map isn’t the best, still, but I think I have an idea.”
 “I trust you. Lead the way, king.”
 “What’s with all the praise suddenly?|
 She shrugged her shoulders while looking at the horizon. 
“Should I stop? I like telling you sweet nothings-… especially because you give me that look. It’s 
hilarious.”
 His face indeed look incredulous. His eyebrows raised, mouth open, just a little shocked. 
“But don’t you dare go crazy with your thoughts. I enjoy telling you that I love you outside of doing 
the nasty, that’s all.”
 She’s right. I never tell her that I appreciate her or that I love her. I 
mean, when we are-… Should I start whispering sweet nothings? Does 
she want that? But, that’s just so-… 
She realized he stopped walking and had that look he has when he’s lost in his thoughts. She wished 
she could read his mind right now, to snap him out of it. She snapped her fingers at him to get his 
attention.
 “Hey, not here, babe. We’re too exposed and we must get a move on-… where are we going to be 
exact?”
 “What? Oh, yeah. We need to keep south then south-east. We will need to cross the River Chionthar at 
one point. I’m not looking forward to it.”
 “Same. But we’ll figure it out, love. We always do.”
 They kept walking while little by little they began to remove themselves from the main road heading 
towards the city they were leaving. 
“First, we need to head towards the narrowest point in the river, so we can corss it safely-… that 
includes-… Helen.”, he rolled his eyes while looking at the cart. It looked like a fat pig with many 
things hanging from it and on it. 
“Don’t worry, Hellen. He likes you. He’s just sour to pretty things.”, she teased.
 As they kept walking, they were very weary of their surroundings. Tav was still not sure about the 
encounter she had with the paladins. She had the feeling the one who spoke to her first was looking for
 a fight, and she wasn’t too far off. A couple of minutes more and they would have encountered five of 
them dressed to the nines in arrongant splendor. Fortunately, her blessings worked well enough for the 
inn-keeper. They found nothing important enough and had no way of pinning anything on the business
 or the owner. 
“So, let’s say you have an opportunity to acquire a home. Money is not a problem. What kind of place 
would you like? I’m curious to know? A small house-… I doubt it. A big one?”
 “You know. I’ve never really thought obout it. Let me think.”
Tav kept pushing the cart and keeping up with his pace, albeit she was going a little faster than her 
normal. Not having all the weight on her back really sped her up. 
“Well, let me tell you about mine. Maybe you get an idea of what don’t want or do want.”
 “Mh, sounds fair.”
 “Back at the clan house, the homes were more like tree houses with spiral stairs leading up and rope 
and wood bridges connecting the houses in branches. Other houses were on the ground. But I didn’t 
like it much. It was beautiful and a sight to behold, of course. But, there was no privacy.”
 Astarion remembered their last outburst when Tav finally allowed herself to reveal parts of her past. 
This was the first time she was painting a picture of where she was born, and eventually banished 
from.
 “So, I think I want something smaller. I would like a place that perhaps in near the woods, but not in 
the woods. Or maybe try my luck at civilization this time. But something made of stone and wood. I 
want the door leading outside to be at the kitchen and have a fireplace in that room. And next to this 
room, I want a room with chairs and pillows, so our friends can sit on them or the floor, like we used 
to and talk  about things. And a restroom with a shower space. I’d like to wash myself inside the house
 and not outside. I don’t like bug bites. Also, a nice large bedroom, but not very large, I think the size 
of the tent is fine.”
 “Well, that’s surely specific. May I ask why?”
 She blushed a little for her reason as she was a little embarrassed that in reality that’s what she wanted 
to have, but with him.
 “For cleaning. A large place means cleaning is a lot of work, or you have to hire workers to help with 
everything and you don’t-…”
 The rest she mumbled more to  herself.
 “Pardon me? I don’t what?”
 She mumbled it again, looking at the cart while turning an even darker shade of red which was 
impressive since it was night out. He smiled.
 “You mean, I don’t like to have many people inside my home?”
 She shook her head to agree. She dared not look at him.
 “Well, I see your point, and you are correct. I don’t want strangers moving around our home, even if I 
paid them.”, he smiled as he said this.
 She let out a breath she didn’t know she was holding. Then looked up to him with a quizzical look.
 “You-… I mean-… our-… home.”
 “Well, of course. A life time of palace that were never mine, I’d like to give a smaller home a try.”
 “You really mean it?”
“Certainly my dear. Besides, you said it yourself, ‘Misery loves company, and I can’t get rid of you 
Mrs. Misery, my fake wife.”, he laughed at this. 
She was surprised that he had a fantastic ear and memory when it was convinient for him, ever the 
rogue. But her heart did skip a bit.
 He will stay. My moon! He wants to give us a chance! I promise I’ll do my best to make this work-… 
and that he doesn’t change his mind.
 “Well, my Mr. Misery, I’d like a garden, too. I’ll work it, so your precious hands don’t get dirty, of 
course.”
 “Well, I’ll leave you to that then, dear. I couldn’t stand the dirt under my nails, but on you, I’d take it 
any day.”
 He reached for her and picked her up in a hug. This was the first time he’s done that. She was beyond 
belief that perhaps he was trying to do something out of his character, but was willing to try. That was 
enough for both. More than enough. 
“Tav. I believe that in your joy for Helen, you forgot something.”
 As she enjoyed his hug, she didn’t want to let go just yet, she moved a little back to see him.
 “What?”
 “We never did take that shower.”
 They both cackled at the thought. She was so mad at him at that time she said it. But then with what 
happened with the paladin, it was fortunate they both forgot. They’ll just have do what they usually 
do, a rag, a bowl, and some soap. Just rub, rub, splash, splash. 
She began to wiggle to get lose, but he held her more firmly while laughing. He knew she disliked 
feeling dirty and sweaty and they hadn’t had a proper change to bathe or shower since the lake with 
Halsin. That was some days ago. In part, visiting Elturel was to sell or trade, but also to take advantage
 of the accomodations, a bath or shower room.
 “Oh! That stupid paladin! May he always feel wet socks and itchy butt!”, she screamed as she shook 
her fist back at the city.
 “Now, now, my dear. I like your stench. It smells a little like me.”, he said with a coy smile.
 “But, now I’m going to feel itchy all over the place. It’s starting already.”, she began scratching her 
neck.
 “Careful with that, love. That’s mine.”
 “Fine. But when we rest, I will use up the waterskins, and you need to clean up, too. Even if you don’t 
smell like onions like I do.”, she blushed as she laughed.
 “Disgusting description, but fine. We’ll shower together.”, he winked at her while finally kissing her. 
His happiness could not be contained at that moment as he spined her around to get her dizzy while he
 kissed her. He knew she wouldn’t apreciate the spin for she already got dizzy when he hugged or 
kissed her. He was also capable of her teasing games. 
He set her down and sure enough, she had to keep hold of Helen, the beast. But she laughed as she 
did. You don’t jyxn happiness when you are heading towards danger. You enjoy it while you have it.
 They kept walking in good spirits being midful of the road and anyone or anything that may be lurking
 around. They both were aware that gnolls and paladins were two of the many things they didn’t want 
to spoil their fun.
 “How many?”, Tav asked while pushing the cart, her grip showing her knuckles tightening. 
“Perhaps 3, maybe 4. Human.”
 “Guards? If it’s that one, I will take him out. He’s starting to spoil my fun.”
 “It might need to get that far, but we’ll have to take all out, not just your one.”
 “Let’s keep walking, then. See if they are after us or just patrolling.”
 Their mood shifted. Now it was a tense situation. They weren’t looking for a fight, at least not today 
and especially not now. Tav wasn’t in the mood. So, they quickened their pace to test them out. 
“Halt! You two, over there.!, shouted one of the paladins.
 “Perhaps, I’ll do the talking.”, said Tav as she handed him the glasses. 
“Very well. I’ll let you to it, for now.”
 “Just know, we’re married. I’m pregnant, and we’re heading home to my parents for the pregnancy.”
 This again? She keeps bringing it up as a tactic. What in the hells is she doing?
 Tav was loosening her pants and sticking her stomach out as much as she could to fake being 
pregnant. If they were paladin guards, they might go lenient on two weirdos walking at night in the 
wilds. She was betting on their ‘righteous’ beliefs and their religious bigotry. Families are meant to be 
a man and a woman and they should be breeding. 
“Just play along, husband. Let me talk first. I don’t want them to see your fangs.”
 “Fine.”, he rolled his eyes now covered by his dark glasses. 
Perhaps this would be enough cover. But then, Tav grabbed a glass vial and removoed the wax seal. 
She threw its contents to Astarion while pretending to fall on to him. A dizzy spell perhaps? Some 
pregnant women had those. Then she poured the rest of the liquid on her. 
The strong sickly sweet smell was overwhelming. But, it might be enough to hide them. The would 
definitely need a shower and clean clothes if they convinced the guards to buzz off. She’s pregnant 
after all and she’s not in the mood.
 The guards caught up to them. Indeed there were 4, and one of them was the one she did not 
particularly like. How typically persistant for some children of a god to be that way.
 “Yes. How may we help you?”, Tav said while forcing a friendly smile. Her stomach under her light 
armor clearly showing.
 The guard who she had met earlier took notice of this and wondered if he had seen that before. This   
changed his plans. Why on earth would a woman in this state be up to something suspicious. Besides, 
he was told that she claimed that was her husband. Perhaps the rumors that he was a vampire were 
false. Vampires can’t breed and she was very much with child. Perhaps 3 months? It wasn’t showing 
much, but enough to know life was happening in there.
 “I’m very sorry, ma’m. We are simply patrolling and were looking for 2 suspicious strangers.”
 “Mh. That means us?,” she said this as she winced and touched her stomach.
 Astarion just stood, but when she did that, he reacted. He reached for her to steady her. 
“Oh, I’m sorry. You’re clearly not-… If you don’t mind my asking, but in your condition why are you 
guys walking at night? These wilds aren’t the safest for anyone, especially for someone like you.”
 “I know, dear. But the thing is the sun makes me sick. I get nauseated and too hot. We’re on our way 
back to my parents home. Night time is my choice-… I prefer it any day.”, She smiled at Astarion who
 smiled back. 
“Oh, very well then. But do be careful, there are gnolls around some areas. Steer clear of going east. 
We’ve seen suspicious movement. If you need assistance in your journey, make sure you reach a post 
along the road.”
 “Well, keep that in mind, young friend. But, it won’t take is too long to reach Berdusk. Perhaps my 
father is already heading towards us as we speak. For sure my brothers are. They know I get impatient.
 Thank you for the warning and aid. Do you need anything else from us?”
 She was starting to get impatient, but she needed to keep her cool. After all, the baby might want to 
come out and fight.
 “No, that was all. Safe travels.”
 “Thank you. Likewise.”
 The paladin guards turned around and headed back to the city. It was clear it was them who they were 
after, but who would want the sin of attacking a pregnant woman, even if her husband looked 
strangely familiar. If he only knew he had just questioned part of Faeruns champions, perhaps his 
arrogant attitude might lessen. But that was doubtful. You had to be when the gods chose you.
“That was-… annoying.”, Tav said as she fixed her armor again. 
“Pregnant? That’s twice you’ve-…”, he said more to himself.
 “It worked. I wondered if it would, but it did. Ha! It’s all right baby. Once we rest, I’ll let you go.”
 She patted her stomach while giving a loving smile. Astarion was very confused about her behavior.  
Then she looked at him and gave him an evil grin.
 “I haven’t pooped. This walk is helping. That guard, too. I’ll name it after him.”, she cackled. 
Now it was Astarion who stop holding his breath. His woman was imposible sometimes. He made no 
comentary lest she start talking about bodily fluids and the like just to annoy him.
 “Anyway, where were we? So a cottage or perhaps a cabin. Not in the woods, but near enough. 
Anything else you want to add, love?”
 “Mh, let’s see. A wash room! And perhaps hire someone to help with making a cistern or something. I 
would like to not have to carry water back and forth all the time. I can’t imagine having to go to the 
river to wash. Not for me, thanks.”
 Astarion would not have thought of that. But it was true, not everything was armor. They had 
underwear, socks, and wash cloths that needed cleaning. Especially now, he needed all of himself to be
 washed. That sicky liquid she used was getting annoying, but it might deter other fiends hiding on the 
fields. If it were up to him, he’d steer clear of himself too if only to avoid the stench.
 “Speaking of, what was that liquid?”
 “Oh, that. It’s disgusting isn’t it? It’s a mix of nasty and nice. Some animal urine, flower petals, honey,
 water from the river, animal fat, and rotten meat. A little of the forest mixed in a vial. You reckon it 
can work on the gnolls? I mean, these goons made no mention of vampires, so-…” 
“Well, gross, but I think so. I can barely stand it myself.”
 She smiled, proud that her theory worked enough. She have to make more, despite still having another
 three vials at the ready. 
“But, I think that’s it. I figured a library can also be where the chairs and pillows are, or the bedroom.”
 She was smiling from ear to ear while describing her ideal little home. He vision was quickly growing 
on him, but we wondered if that meant here or the Underdark. There was a lot uncertainty in their 
wishes as of now.
 “Library. Got it.”
 “But what about you? You reckon we will be settling in the Underdark forever? I would like to find a 
place where we could make a settlement for our kin, you know. Like a little village of like-minded 
folks that want to work together to make life worth living. You know what I mean?”
 Astarion’s shocked face was almost caught by Tav. 
What? Is that her plan? That is certainly a bold move even for her? That’s 
a lot of my kind together without a master to keep them in check. Does she 
think they can even control themselves? Could they? She certainly has a lot
 of faith in them, more than I. But, her kin? Does she want to become a-…
 “Huh? Oh, I don’t know. I mean, the sun will be an issue always, so-..”
 “Well, I don’t mind to be down there then. The thing is my babes deserve a chance. They were stolen 
from life. It wasn’t heir fault. And no one is in your corner, ever. I get it, but still-… I just want them to 
have a chance. Give them a choice. They aren’t animals. They are people, like me, like you. I will fight 
for them, too.”
 She said with such conviction as a tear rolled down her cheek. She was perhaps wrong in her ideals, but 
she was stubborn enough to try. She had claimed them too back at the palace.
 “I don’t think it will be easy to get them to get along, especially with me around, but I know that you’re 
dead set on it. I will help you in your insane plan. Besides, a lot of your insane plans have worked 
before.”, He said as he was trying to find her same conviction. 
Since they had set out, they didn’t talk about what they would do once they arrived, but now she was 
showing at least a snippet as to why she chose to come. She claimed the vampire spawn as her kin and 
will fight for them to have a right to exist. But in what way? They are monsters? Do they deserve a 
chance to live and love, too?
 “Hear me out. What if my babes-… what if they can be convinced that they deserve a chance at life, 
even now. That we could establish a land where we can thrive together? I mean, you were a magistrate 
before, you may still have some of how to manage rules and things like that for a town? I don’t know. I 
mean, I’ve lived alone for most of my life, but I’ve been to cities. Sure, it gets bad, but rules can help 
folks behave and get along-… can’t they?”
 “To be honest-… I have no recollection of my past prior. I was 39 and I was from an afluent family. If 
anything, I’d think I was pretty rotten. Most of my kind were because we held money and power. I 
wouldn’t be surprised that the Gur that attacked me were dealing with their kind of justice or perhaps it 
was Cazador’s doing. I may never know.”
 “What about books? What if, given the chance, we read up on the topic? I can contact Gale. Like, we lay
 the ground work to have a basic understanding on how to handle a community or something. There must
 be something, anything for that. You civilized folk have books for just about anything, why not on the 
topic of how to build a village for vampires or something?”
 Her frustration was not lost on him. She was really going to push it. Perhaps it was time he pushed for it 
too, after all she was dead set that they deserved to live after being stolen from life. 
“You have a point-… I think. At least about the books. Perhaps you should contact Gale at some point, 
and why not, Lae’Zel.”, he laughed at the last suggestion. 
Lae’Zel was no nonsense and though she wouldn’t like the idea of gathering a lot of spawn together tor 
establish a town, she was the best when it came to rules and order. The only scary thing was that, so was
Tav, but she didn’t show it as much as Lae’Zel did. Perhaps that was why they had a mutual liking and 
respect for each other. 
As they kept moving the occasionally saw moving shadows in the distance, but not near enough to react.
 They knew they were in dangerous territory and would have to fight at some point. Though, Tav was 
starting to show that she was spent.
 “I think we should set up camp over there, it’s just enough away from that paladin post which may help 
keep other things away.”
 Tav yawned and agreed. 
“I’d like that. I’m spent. I didn’t get much sleep after you left.”
 “Why was that? You were gone once you hit the pillow.”
 “I had a nightmare. I woke up and you were gone. I had a bit of a panic, so I busied myself with 
whatever I could. I cleaned my boots, I fixed the packs, I threw out the water. I also called Karlach and 
Wyll. They say hi by the way. Then I called Gale. They calmed my nerves. It worked. I was about to go 
find you. I get nervous if I’m alone, still.”
 “Well, I’m glad I don’t make you nervous then. And would you mind telling me about your nightmare?”
 “You and I both know what it was. It is either you dying and I go out with you or I die and you do the 
same. Let’s get real, Astarion, I’ve been alone most of my short life, which means I will probably make 
stupid decisions, especially regarding you. I don’t want to keep fighting the good fight if you’re not here
 with me. So, deal with it. I love you and I want to stay with you for the rest of your days or the rest of 
mine.”
 “Mh, curious. I’ve had those nightmares, too. So, that settles it then. You were very honest about 
sticking around if only to spite me. Then, let’s set up home, then. By the way, I know I don’t say this 
often, but thank you. I’m glad you chose me that night. Even if my motives were the wrong ones. I will 
spend the rest of my days making up for it.”
 “Don’t bother. Just be, but let me just be, with you. I don’t ask much. I just want your company. I like it.
 I like you. I feel safe. My mind calms down when you’re around. That’s why I keep telling you my love 
is selfish. I think we both get something good out of our situation.”
 “I think so, too. And, you’re right. It is nice. Well, here we are. I’ll begin setting up tent, then I’ll help 
you with the warding stakes.”
 “Sounds like a plan, love. But let’s hurry. The sky is changing color.”
 So, they began their now common ritual of setting up camp, but now it was home away from home. 
They hurried with their tasks and set up all the little things they had to. Tav kept her Helen near the 
entrance, tied to a stake. Astarion also took care of setting up a small fire for Tav. She might need it later.
 Once inside, with the light of some candles and an oil lamp, they continued their chat. But this time, Tav
 thought up of another idea, that Astarion would have to help with. 
“I am wondering if I could-… I mean, in theory it could work. You from inside and I do the outside bit.”
 “Woman, what on Faerun are you on about?”
 “I’m thinking on expanding our house! Look, I want to attach my poop tent to this side of the big one 
and in such a way that they can be separated and folded as usual, but I could have access and you, too.”
 He rolled his eyes and gave her a grimace showing his fangs.
 “Well, what is your plan then, out with it.”
 “Attach it here like a little flap door, but it needs to be connected with leather straps. We can access it 
from inside the tent, and maybe keep the other flap-… so that makes 2 entry points-… mmm, perhaps 
just enter through the tent and keep the rest closed-… the idea is to attach it so you can shower right 
now without needing to step outside to enter it.”
 He said nothing. He clearly was coming up with either a counterpoint or a complaint. Either way, that 
was very much him. But he found none. Her logic was solid enough. He had his cloak and he could use 
that, but here she was again trying to accommodate his living space for his needs and hers, too. 
“Very well. Seems logical. What do you need me to do?”
 She gave him a giant smile. She was grateful he also was accommodating to her quirks. When they 
traveled in a larger group, it was rare for him to fully notice her little quirks. They were all busy in their 
own little worlds together that there was little reason for complaints. Well, except when she licked the 
spider. Perhaps Gale still has nightmares about that. 
So they worked quickly, but they did it together. They were more in sync now than they were before the 
parasites destruction. This meant that they didn’t have the chance to hear or feel each other’s mind, now 
they had to pay attention and make a wild guess. By now, they were getting better at guessing right. 
By the end of it, she had her extension ready with the proper branches, trenches, holes, and the leather 
straps to hold the water skins. 
“Very well. It’s ready. So, I’m going to need you to-… test it. I’m sorry, but we have to see if it will hold
 or not. I’m right here to help if it doesn’t work properly.”
 Tav pointed at the new hole on the side of the larger tent that now connected to the smaller one. She had 
a worried look, but was trying to be enthusiastic. It would either work fine or cause him some pain and 
discomfort. 
He exhaled slowly. He wasn’t terrified of checking if it would hold or not, but he also wasn’t to keen on 
feeling pain. 
“Just do the one hand.”
 He agreed and pushed his left hand through the flap and held it there. They counted to 60. Nothing. No 
pain, no blisters, no smoke. She was holding on to his right hand. She counted loudly to another 60. 
Still, nothing. He was safe. No burning. No blisters. They both finally exhaled and looked at each other 
and smiled. 
“Guess who needs a shower?”, Tav said while walking towards her pack. 
She grabbed a new pair of everything from underwear and socks to a new top. She had at least 2 sets of 
armor but 5 outfits that went under. This allowed her to stay clean and dry and to wash the clothes, too. 
Living in the woods let her understand that keeping clean and dry is the difference between surviving a 
cut or dying of infection. 
She left her things on the bed of pelts, took off her boots, and simply stripped down. She was still 
blushing, but she figured he’s seen her many times now. Then she turned around and he was there, 
looking at her, also bare and ready to share the space. After all, she had said they were going to shower 
together back at Elturel.
 “Let’s go my love. You’ve got to rest.”
 “I hate that I love when you beat me to the punch.”
 She got on her tip toes to give him a peck on the lips. Then she stepped into the smaller tent. 
“Did you bring the wash cloths?”, he asked her.
 “Yeah, they’re right next to the skin hanging right there. Just pour some water on the basin first. I’ll add 
the soap.”
 So, they helped each other lather their backs and he scrubbed her hair then bent down for her to do the 
same. They giggled and at times even laughed. It was a tight space, but they made it work for them. This
 time she had thought of putting rocks on the little trench and on top of it she fashioned a little mat of 
sticks and grass-rope. This allowed the water to collect down the trench and into a later hole he had help
 dig. Like this their water wouldn’t pool nor go into the tent. 
They ended up using the 2 large water skins, but that was fine. The river was still walking distance and 
they were heading that way tonight. But if she needed water before that, she could take Helen and make 
a run for it and come back in a pinch.
 When they finished rinsing the soap off, Tav laughed.
 “I forgot to grab something to dry off.” 
“I don’t think it matters.”, he told her as he picked her up and carried her out carefully.
 He walked to the bed of pelts and lay her there. She felt a little too bare, so she tried to cover herself.
 “Please, don’t. I want to lay next to you like this. Would you let me?”
 “Oh, that sounds-… that sounds nice.”
 She moved over to let him lay beside her. His cold touch to hers was lovely. She was very hot right now,
 but his lack of heat balanced her temperature to something comfortable. 
He snuggled on her bosom and she began to run her fingers through his curls.
“Astarion?”
 “Yes, Tav?”
 “I love you.”
 He squeezed her a little more with his arm on top of her stomach in a sort of incomplete hug.
 “I love you, too. More than I dare to admit myself.”
 “I’m fine with that.”
 “Thank you.”
 “Thank you, my pale elf.”
 They stayed there, in their own thoughts, hugging each other without saying a word for a little while. 
Then Tav’s breathing slowed down and deepened. Her heartbeat slowed, too. She was asleep. Astarion 
smiled and simply stayed there, his head on her chest as best as he could. His new favorite melody had 
become Tav and her humanity. He wasn’t sure if he longed to be alive or to just be able to keep her 
forever. Either way, right now he was grateful he had her and she wanted that.
 They slept about 4 hours, well Tav did. He meditated or at least that’s what he’d want us to believe. She 
ban to stir. She felt a pain on her leg. She sat up straight in a panic.
 “Crap!”, she shouted while reaching down to rub her leg.
 Astarion was startled, too. 
“What’s wrong?! What’s going on? Are you hurt?”
 “Sort of-… ah-… stupid leg. I’ve got a cramp. Get my pack will ya. I’ve got a little green pouch on the 
outside bag. Yeah, that one. Hand it over.”
 He gave her the pouch and she took a little metal tin with a lid and opened it. It smelled very minty. She 
took some of the substance that looked a little like clarified fat and crushed mint leaves. And began 
rubbing her leg quickly. She needed to make friction to create heat. Her legs where tired and she was 
now too cold. That was a recipe for cramps on her legs and feet. Unfortunately, she had many cramp 
recipes, but she had enough ointment to help soothe the muscle. 
“Feeling better? That thing smells-… pungent.” 
“Sorry, but it helps. My leg’s are tired from all the walking and I got cold enough that I got a cramp. At 
least it wasn’t my toes. I hate that.”
 “Mm, I am sort of glad I don’t have those then. But, perhaps we should get dressed. Will you go hunting
 for food? You last ate at the inn.”
 “I think I still got some food. I bought some at the inn before we left. I’ll just eat that and once we get 
closer to crossing the river, I’ll perhaps do some fishing.”
 “Sounds good.”
 “Are you feeling a bit peckish? Please let me know, love. I need you in your best shape.”
He thought about it. He didn’t always want to use her, but she was right. She was right that her blood 
cleared his mind and also that wasn’t using her, despite his belief. She gave herself willingly and that 
was her choice. She saw it more as a gift she was wiling and able to offer. 
Fair to say it was a complicated dynamic for both, but she was never forced to feed him nor she forced 
him to feed. It was just facts. His mind was clear if the blood came for a thinking individual and she 
didn’t want him feeding on anyone else but her and animals. She always has said her love is selfish after
 all.
 “Perhaps before you feed. Like this you have some food in you then.”
 “Sounds good.”
 Tav noticed he was looking doubtful about his suggestion. She was aware of his emotions better now 
and knew that he could spiral again. After all, they had been avoiding their conversation from the inn. 
“Hey, look at me. No. And also, stop it. No. It’s my choice and I am never forced. The day I don’t want 
to, I will say no. Until then, suck it up. I mean, deal with it.”, she told him this while pointing her finger 
at him.
 She hated to do it this way, but he was stubborn, too. But he said nothing, he just stood up and crossed 
his arms. There was nowhere he could go right now. The sun was bright out and unless she stepped out 
of the tent, he was stuck in there with her. 
She kept looking at him with a stern face. It seemed that they were gearing up to dish it out again. They 
were rested, yet hungry. 
“Perhaps you can eat first.”
 “Clever. But don’t change the subject. You won’t be able to charm yourself out of this one. So, either 
spit it out or knock it off.”
 He tilted his head back in exasperation. She wasn’t going to let it go yet he was the one who was making
 a big deal about it. 
“Fine. Just stand up then.”
 She did as was told, wearing only socks and a thin knitted blanket. She walked over to him, which 
wasn’t much. The tent wasn’t very big. 
“Which side? Left? Right? Up? Down?”, she smirked. 
“Funny.”, he rolled his eyes.
 Then he grabbed her wrists and pulled her arms up. Her blanket dropped, and she gasped. If he was 
going to do this, he was going to make the best of it. He moved her to the side of the tent to serve as an 
aid to pin her. He placed his keen between her legs and gave her a little growl. Then he moved her wrists
 to one hand while he lifted her with the other. Now in his arm, he let her go and held her. With his knee 
he had moved her so that she was straddling him.
 “You done? Come on then. All you do to avoid it. Stop playing.”, she rolled her eyes.
He laughed a little. He was stalling. Then he stopped being stubborn, but he was going to pretend he 
didn’t like this nor that he enjoyed having her. 
“Left.”
 “Fine.”, she whispered as she tilted her head to leave her neck better exposed. 
She inhaled a sharp breath as his fangs sinked into her skin. He could feel how her nails dug into his 
back a little. By now, she had learned that she needs to keep taking deep breaths while he fed. This 
helped her not be very dizzy after. He also learned that 4 large gulps were enough, 5 if he was injured, 
but if he slowed himself, he could stay like that a little longer. Today, he was taking it slow. 
“Mmm.”
 Well, as long as Tav didn’t ignite his baser instinct which she very much could, especially right then and
 there. Then her hands reached up to his neck, like a soft caress of feathers on his cool skin. Then she 
found what she wanted. The soft velvety texture of his hair, his curls, the coolness of his scalp, she 
would get as much of it as she could. Besides, he’s the one that put her in that position and started to 
play with his food. 
Then he finally let go. He licked her neck to help heal the two puncture wounds and set her down.
 “How do you feel?”
 “Hungry.”, she said back with her now too familiar grin.
 She leaned in and bit his waist. She didn’t do much, but it did startle him enough to lose his balance in 
shock.
 “What in hells, woman?!” he said in disbelief.
 She cackled as she went for another bite. She was aiming for his butt, but he kept moving. 
“Stop moving! Let me eat you!”
 Tav laughed and kept chomping the air. He wasn’t sure how to react, so he just kept moving out of her 
bite. 
“No, you stop it.”
 “No, you stop it.”
 “Stop mocking me, woman!”
 “Never. Come here, snack!”
 Her trick worked. He didn’t notice her position to trip him. He fell back and landed on his butt. She then
 threw herself at him, now pinning him down. Now, she straddled him while he was beneath her. 
“What are you planning to do, Mrs. Misery?”
 “Play with my food. See how you like it, Mr. Staller.”
She laughed and leaned in to kiss him. She wasn’t mad at him, but she was in a good mood, enough to 
bug him a little before heading out to the cart.
 “You are impossible. My impossible woman. Gods, I love you!”, he said as he pulled her in for another 
kiss. 
She couldn’t help but laugh as he kissed her. Then he let her go. She nuzzled his neck and gave him a 
kiss. Then she got off him and stood up.
 “Okay, my love. I must go over there. I will be back shortly. Keep away from the flap. Please and thank 
you.”
 He rolled his eyes, but gave her a smile. He placed his hands behind his head, crossed his legs, and 
closed his eyes.
 “Good feast.”
 “Thank you.”
 She walked to the tent flap and wiggled her way out to minimize the light from entering. As safe as the 
tent was, she knew it was still a delicate shelter.
 Once outside, she had to wait a minute to let her eyes while adjusting her blanket as a makeshift dress. 
All she had now was Astarion’s shoes on, her wool socks, her blanket, and a giant smile from ear to ear. 
Just knowing that god made flesh inside that tent wearing nothing more than a smile which she gave 
him, was enough to make her sprout wings. She would fly to the moon and back if only to thank her for 
leading her right to that beach. Tav gave a silent scream out of joy. She did a little shimmy to control her
 emotions, and began to get her things to prepare her food.
 She placed her small pan on the fire which had died down. She added a bit of wood he had left for her. 
She did another shimmy. She was giddy, but perhaps it was due to the blood loss. She got out some 
cheese and dry meat. She cut up the meat to fit in the pan and added water from her drinking water skin 
and put the lid on. She took a pinch of salt from her little leather salt pouch and added it to the meat and 
water. Then she took a sprig of rosemary and placed it in, too. She waited for it to evaporate the water. 
As she waited, she went around the tent to do a bit of scouting. It was too bright out right now. If 
anything would to attack, it would probably wait for night. In the far distance, she saw glints of light, 
like little mirrors reflecting the sun. Probably the paladin scouts doing patrols. She paid them no mind. 
She then took a chunk of cheese and added it in and covered the pan again. She waited less now. Finally,
 she put four slices of bread on top and put the lid. Now it didn’t close properly, but she just needed the 
bread to be a little warm, not to make toast. 
Then she removed the pan from the heat with a piece of nubuck leather to not burn herself. Then placed 
the little pot on the fire and added some water. She then rummaged her pack again to find her herbs 
pouch. This time it would be a nettle with dandelion root with a pinch of bloodrose berry. Once the 
water started to boil, she removed this from the fire and added her herbs and a dash of honey. Then she 
poured some of this into a wooden cup. She then got her fork and stabbed it in her food, took her cup, 
and grabbed the pan with the leather piece.
 “I’m going in.”
No answer. He was probably asleep after feeding, too. She smiled at the sight.
 That is the most beautiful man I have ever seen. 
She sat down at he edge of their bed of pelts and began to eat. As she ate, she began to sway from side 
to side. She did this when she was eating and happy. Like the shimmy she had done prior, sometimes 
you just need your body to let go of excess happiness lest you pop.
 As her back was to him, she didn’t notice how he was watching her sway as she enjoyed her food. He 
smiled.
 She’s the first person I’ve ever encountered that enjoys her meals as much. Perhaps this is part of what 
she wanted me to observe. Not all love needs to result in sex, I guess. Pity, I’m quite good at it, but-… I 
like this-… intimacy. She is an impossible woman. I’ve seen her in battle and she’s quite vicious, even 
for me. No one would believe that she sways in happiness for eating peasant food. No banquets, no 
feast, just rehydrated meat, cheese, and stale bread. No one would believe she just fed a vampire and 
now drinks a tea to help her recuperate faster. She’s a sorceress and she’s none the wiser about it. And 
she’s mine. Perhaps I will learn to be alive again if only for her.
 His train of thought was interrupted for Tav had moved herself to have her back touch the soles of his 
feet. 
“Keep them there or perhaps-… can you step on my back, like push a little hard?”
 “Would you like me to give you a massage instead?”
 “Sure, but first step. I want to know how your feet feel on my back. I dunno-… I’m curious”, she 
giggled.
 She really had no real explanation for it other than, it must feel nice to have his cool feet pressed on my 
back. She was right. It did feel nice. 
“Are you happy now, my little weirdo?”
 “Yes. Very much. I’m happier. But, perhaps I’ll take you up on the massage later. I just ate and if I lay 
on my stomach, it may come out.”
 “Disgusting, but fine. So, what’s the plan?”
 She said with a disappointed look. 
“I think we need to take the time to double check our gear and weapons. Can you sharpen mine please? I
 need to get dressed and make a run to the river bank for some supplies.”
 “I don’t like the idea of you going alone, but I suppose there are patrols right now and it is day time, so
… remember you are-… pregnant.”, he said that last word with a bit of hurt in his voice.
 “There it is. Yes, I will be careful and mindful, but I need to have extra arrows, just in case. I’ll fill of 
with water. We need to wash some stuff and there’s no water left. But, Astarion, we will need to have 
that talk sooner than later. It’s been looming over us and I need you focused.”
 “Fine. Let’s talk when you come back. Be very careful.”
As she stood up, she began to get dressed, but decided to not wear armor. Instead she put on her own 
boots this time, her undergarments, her leather pants with cloth lining, and her short sleeved blouse. It 
looked more like a green uniform than something Astarion would wear. She only got her bracers on for 
these had her throwing needles. She fixed her utility knife on her belt and kept a smaller coin purse 
attached, too. 
“Get dressed my love, we’ve got a lot to do before we head out tonight.”
 He kissed her forehead before she went to the side tent to use the restroom and get her water skins. She 
was glad she wast taught how to make the necessary items to keep up her hygiene no matter what 
function needed it. After all, she did have to name it after the paladin, but feel clean and fresh 
afterwards.
 “I’m off. See you in a bit. I love you.”
 “Be very careful, my love.”
 She then wiggled her way out again out of the tent and waited a little to get her eyes adjusted to the 
light. She decided to just go in a straight line. She removed the other pan from Helen- the cart, to reduce
 the noise. She placed her water skins on it, and took off running.
 With the speed she gained, she was able to jump on it and ride it. 
“I really wanted to do this! Woo!’
 It was the bumpiest most uncomfortable ride, but she needed this. She couldn’t shimmy right now. At 
least for right now, they were safe despite it all. Just safe.
