Chapter 4- From Settlements to Covens; rules, vows, and expectations
 Petras decided to walk around the place and check it out, while Dalyria 
simply went to stand by the wall with windows to see outside. They had just 
ben told so many truths in a little time. 
As for Astarion, he just went to the secret room acting as a bedroom. River 
just stayed in the kitchen looking at the fire. All there was to do now, was 
wait. But, she didn’t wait long. The first to return was Dalyria. She sat down 
across her. 
Dr. Dalyria: “Can we trust you?”
 River: “That’s not for me to say. People who’ve met me could surely vouch 
for me, but I cannot say that myself. What I can say is that I chose you to be 
my kin.”
 Dr. Dalyria: “What do you mean by that? My kin-… our kin? The spawn?
 River: “I’m sorry, but my answers aren’t simple. I was born in a clan of woo
elves where at some point in our story, human blood was introduced. He was 
the reason for many good things, but also a lot of horrible things. I was 
trained to be ferocious since I was but a wee babe. Then, I was banished. I 
was cast out. I lost everything and everyone in a day. I then lived my life in 
suffocating solitude. Being with Astarion has helped me not feel alone, 
abandoned any more. Then, at the palace I saw the people who were the 
victims of a mad man. His people, the cast out, the abandoned, the abused. 
My people, too. I have done a lot of things to ensure that we can provide you 
lot a safe space to rest, at least for now.”
 Dr. Dalyria: “But, I don’t understand. You must understand that all that you 
say makes little sense. Why-… why do you want to become the champion for
 us the spawn? And of Selune, no less! It all seems-…”
 River: “Stupid? Yes. Hard to believe? Of course. That I likely have ulterior 
motives? Definitely. I do.”
She showed shock. She wasn’t going to say ‘stupid’, but that was the easiest 
way to put it. It was insane to even think about it, but the little war-machine 
was already in motion. River couldn’t simply vow on her wedding day to 
protect her now husband and his people before Selune to then turn around 
and say ‘nevermind’ just because it was hard. Life isn’t easy, but it is. It will 
always be full of contradictions that matter. Contradictions that are worth 
they blood, sweat, and tears that it costs to live life. 
River: “Listen. I made a promise, a vow, to a divine no less. I can’t take it 
back. And it’s for something very difficult, impossible even, but I have to at 
least try. As for my ulterior motive? I see you as my family, too. I don’t see 
you as vampire spawn. I see you as people first. You all were abducted and 
infected. Then you were trapped. That was unfair. Believe me, had I been 
born back then, and I had known, I would have done the same thing I am 
doing now. But I wasn’t.”
 Dr. Dalyria: “River, just how old are you now? If you don’t mind me 
asking?”
 River: “I am 40. Astarion still doesn’t believe me. He says I feel at least 100. 
But, no. I just had to grow up very fast.” 
Dr. Dalyria: “May I ask you a personal question? If you don’t mind, of 
course.”
 River: “Sure, Doc. Ask away.”
 Dr. Dalyria: “Do you know of his past? I mean, when he was alive?”
 River: “I do. When we had the parasite, it would sometimes allow us to 
connect our minds. He showed me a lot of himself, mostly by accident. I did, 
too.”
 Dr. Dalyria: “Then why are you with him? Even among us, he was-… 
difficult.”
 River: “You mean he was an asshole. And he rivaled the idiot who took you. 
Well, he still is an asshole. And I wouldn’t be surprised that was the reason he
 was attacked by the Gur. But I like to belive that I am his penance.”
 Dr. Dalyria: “What do you mean by that?”
River: “A vampire spawn falls in love with a mortal. Same spawn having the 
complete corrupted power of his fallen master, decides to not take it. He then 
decides to free his own kin instead of taking it out on you. He chose a life in 
the shadows over complete and corrupted power in the sun. He could have 
turned 14,000 more people to serve him. He didn’t. He chose to fall in love 
with a live one. What’s worse, Selune’s champion. I am his penance for the 
wrong he commited before I even existed. Perhaps that is why I came to be. 
Who knows. But, I love him for who he has been to me. I can’t hate him for 
the crimes he commited in his past. But, between you and I, my love is 
selfish. My love has always been conditional. My love is hard work.”
 Dr. Dalyria: “No wonder I can see he’s changed.”
 River: “It’s the eyes, isn’t it? He also smiles and it’s genuine. I’d like to 
believe that he is learning to feel what happy is. What love is, too.”
 Dr. Dalyria: “You seem rather genuine, too. It’s not every day you meet 
someone who is so ready, so willing to simply pour their heart out. I won’t 
lie, I have a lot of distrust in you, but that’s more because I don’t know you.”
 River: “Yes. And also, because you too were conditioned to be trapped and 
tortured. Trust doesn’t come easy, and I think it shouldn’t. I need you, all of 
you, to demand that I earn your trust. I have to prove myself to you everyday.
 I have to do it. Love is hard work and I need to show you with proof that I 
care. It’s the only way.”
 Dr. Dalyria: “That’s what makes it hard to believe. You’re conviction to help 
those like me, but what do you get in return?”
 River: “I get to belong.”
 Petras came into the kitchen just then and sat down. He had a face of 
someone that had a lot of questions and curiosity. The second one being the 
one he had the most. 
Petras: “I’m sorry to interrupt, but I don’t believe it. I mean, you have life, 
you can walk in the sun, you’re pretty. You could be with someone like you 
and have a family. But you decided to marry a vampire?! And Astarion, no 
less!”
 River: “Hahahahaha. I know. It’s stupid. And I agree. I could have. But I 
didn’t. A month ago, I would tell you that I can’t have children as well, but 
now-… I’m not so sure. And yes, I know Astarion isn’t everyone’s cup of tea,
 but he’s my cup of tea. At least, I feel that I don’t have to worry.”
 Dr. Dalyria: “What do you mean?”
 River: “The thing is that-… well-… I struggle with my own image. I find him
 to be so elegant and smart and I’m just a bog-witch. I mean, I grew up rather 
wild. I learned a lot of how to behave within society from him and the others.
 There are a lot of redeeming qualities I see. Even then, I saw them. But, to be
 fair, my perspective is extremely biased. He was nice to me.”
 Petras: “But he doesn’t do nice. He doesn’t know nice.”
 Dr. Dalyria: “Petras!”
 River: “No, he’s right. I won’t lie about him. You know a lot of his 
personality. And like I said, he’s still an asshole. But, he’s my asshole, you 
know. Besides, he’s been behaving better and better. I think he’s learning how
 to be more patient. I mean, he puts up with me and my bullshit all the time.”
 Dalyria looked around the place and saw that it was clean. She saw the 
clothes on the clothes line and the fireplace. She saw how despite the broken 
walls, there was no rubble or cobwebs. She would even dare believe that this 
place was cleaner than the palace ever was. And Astarion wasn’t known to be
 the type to care about clean spaces. He just cared about himself.
 Dr. Dalyria: “I can see that this place is rather well kept. So, he-… helps?”
 River: “Yes. All the time. Sometimes I feel like my ‘aliveness’ creates such 
and inconvinience. I mean, I can live in a hole in the ground just fine, but 
he’s regal. He was a magistrate in Baldur’s. I can’t have him live in the 
ground with me. So, I keep a good home. Well, I try. Some things here are a 
little for difficult. I mean, the bathroom use alone is a pain down here, but to 
go up to the temple is annoying if I just gotta pee.”
Petras: “Huh. I never really considered that. It’s been so long, that I’ve 
forgotten. So, where do you go?”
 Dalyria shot him a look. She was like the big sister to her stupid little brother 
and Astarion was the eldest who moved out and tried to lose contact with the 
rest. Tried, but couldn’t. He didn’t have it in him-… anymore. 
River: “It’s fine. I want you to keep me honest. So, I apologize for this. It will
 depend. If I can make it, I will climb up the tower on the right, and go in the 
mountain side. Then I just fire bolt it. But if I ignored it and I won’t make it, I
 got a bucket. Then I go and after I fire bolt that, too. There is no sewer here, 
so I just burn it.”
 Petras: “Uh, that explains the lack of smell. Back at Baldur, you can always 
tell, even at the homes of well off people, it always carries an odor.”
 River: “Yeah, I cannot have that. I might have grown up like an animal, but I 
don’t have to behave like one anymore.”
 Petras: “But then, what’s the plan with all of this? How do we enter your 
insane doings? Isn’t that what you were going to tell us before?”
 Dr. Dalyria: “Perhaps we should get Astarion for this.”
 River: “He’s over there. He’s been listening this whole time. I got nothing to 
hid from him. And even if I tried, he’d figure it out anyway.”
 They both looked over where there was a hole on the wall covered by wood 
planks. River continued.
 River: “So, this is a work in progress and I know the objective. But getting 
there is what is so hard to come up with. I’ve only got some vague ideas. 
And, if you’re willing, I really need your help.”
 She took a deep breath. She didn’t even have a clear idea of what they were 
doing. 
River: “The goal is a series of smaller settlements where we provide a safe 
space to rest, perhaps even to live long term for the vampire spawn. We start 
here and we spread out. Simple rooms to begin with. Perhaps one day we can
 take the operation up there with proper housing, bigger for those who want it,
 but with all the protections to keep you all sun-safe. Even expand into 
hospitals, and schools, and-… basically, allow you all to get back the life that
 was stolen, but with the perspective that it’s for you all to be safe and to 
thrive. It’s just a thought. But, to make it a reality needs a lot of work and a 
lot of minds to get it going. So, what do you think?”
 Their faces were certainly shocked. Astarion was right about her. She was 
mad.
 Petras: “What?! I can’t-…”
 Dr. Daryria: “Settlements-… for us? Housing? Schools? Hospitals? But-…”
 River: “I know, but I don’t believe that just because you were infected with a 
curse doesn’t mean you deserve to life like a creature. You are people first. 
Sickness second. Who knows if we can find a cure for it, but we can at least 
make the burden less. You deserve a safe space to live. And I want you all to 
have the possibility to love and to have a better quality of life.”
 Petras laughed, hard. He couldn’t believe that this stranger not only married 
Astarion, but this is offering was unheard off. Vampires were scum of the 
earth. No one wanted them anywhere. They brought chaos and death, and to 
put them together in settlement, or a series of them was just beyond his 
comprehension.
 But, Doctor Dalyria was caught between her scientific mind and her years of 
torment. There was the possibility to have hope of a cure, but at least 
something more probable was the chance to have a home without torture. A 
safe space for them. The fact that River saw them as people with a type of 
sickness. 
River was going to fight Faerun just to give them a space to be safe, to live. 
So, Dal spoke first. 
Dr. Dalyria: “Let’s say that I join your mad plan. What would I get out of it? 
It’s an impossible feat, but perhaps it could work.”
 River: “Well, I don’t know what you would get out of it. I can only work on 
offering a safe space for the 7,000 to live, or at least those who are willing to 
join. But, what do you want out of it? Perhaps we can work together to get it. 
I don’t know. I mean, crazy things happen all the time.”
 Dr. Dalyria: “I want a hospital. I want to practice medicine again.”
 River: “I love the idea-… but, serving who? Do vampires need medical 
services? What I mean is that we will need to set very specific grown rules to 
navigate the spaces we create.”
 Dr. Dalyria: “Well-… I mean,..”
 River: “The thing is simple but very complicated at the same time. We well 
need to not be considered a threat to the living. The living also behave like 
animals, especially when threatened. Our very nature causes them to fear us. 
When they fear, they become eratic. That causes them to attack. One of them,
 we can take down, but get a whole town together. Add that they have their 
paladins to help. We would stand no chance. And all because, stupidly 
wanted to behave like animals, too.”
 Dr. Dalyria was thinking hard about all of this. This wasn’t just a simple plan 
of making housing, this was something that demanded rules and expectations 
to be upheld to ensure survival as a people. 
She thought to herself:
 This is all too much. But, to have my own space, my own hospital and a 
protector of all of it-… could I manage it? The bloodlust, a hospital?
 Astarion: “I know that it is a lot to take in. I’d say you don’t decide on your 
answer right now. But, do consider the options and possibilities.”
He said this as he was walking into the kitchen where the rest were. He knew 
Petras was still trying to make sense, but figured Dal was also. He had gotten 
time to slowly process the options, but for them it was a crash course into 
being human again. At least Astarion had gotten a chance to keep feeding on 
River which made his bloodlust controllable. But there was no more willing 
participant. And he was not willing to share his woman with anyone, 
especially Petras. River knew this, so she never brought it up. Her body 
belonged to him because she desired it, so. 
Astarion: “Back at Balur, River and I spoke about you all. I know that I’m the
 reason, or at least for most of you, the reason that you are cursed. I still think 
we did the right thing in letting you all go. Suggesting the Underdark was 
also a choice to keep you all safe from the sun. I mean, sure it is a dangerous 
place, but isn’t it dangerous anywhere? There is only so much damage you 
can do here, isn’t it? I know that you all need guidance to navigate this new 
freedom after being caged for so long. But, I have faith that you all can 
behave, otherwise the consequences in the Underdark and back on top aren’t 
very forgiving. Like River said, scare enough folks and we will be hunted 
until there’s no one left. We will all have to live with the choices we make, 
but now we are free to choose them.”
 River gave him a smile as he walked over to her and sat down. He was 
looking at his siblings intently. Then he continued.
 Astarion: “I’m not here to become your leader or master or anything of the 
sort. I’d like to see myself as more of a teacher or a guide. I have had the 
longest time living outside of the grasps por the monster that made us. I have 
learned or rather unlearned all the torment that he taught us to navigate the 
world. And I have to live with the consequences of my actions. For starters, 
River is very capable of killing me. In fact, she almost did.”
Dalyria looked at her with shock. Seen how they behave now is not expected 
of someone who would kill their beloved, but what she didn’t know is that it 
was exactly the reason. 
River: “When at the ritual, I wasn’t going to try and convince Astarion to let 
you all go. I didn’t want him to become like Cazador, but it wasn’t my place 
to force him to do what I wanted. So, I had to accept that if he completed the 
ritual and killed all of you, I was to kill him soon after. I was going to 
sacrifice myself to ensure he didn’t make it out alive from that chappel.”
 Astarion: “Back at the ritual, all I could see was the power on offer and the 
safety it promised. I was so blinded by it. Just as Cazador was. But she saw 
something in me- someone else I could be. Someone who could break the 
cycle of power and terror that started centuries ago. She saved me back there.
 I admit I may not have appreciated at the time, but I do now. I’m thankful. 
She gave me a chance to live again and I took it. She’s extending the same 
olive branch to the rest of you. But it is up to you to take it.”
 Petras: “So, what are the rules of your game? What is expected of us to 
participate in this insane experiment of protecting us?
 River: “Self-control to start.”
 Petras: “SELF-CONTROL! But we’re vampires! We take, we feed, we 
consume. How do you think 7,000 of us will manage that? It’s ridiculous.”
 River jumped out of the bench she sat at and pinned Petras down with a blade
 to his throat. The other was on his side, not cutting unless he moved to get 
free. He finally saw what Astarion had been trying to tell them without telling
 them. River showed him. Self-control.
She kissed him on the forehead and got off him. Then directed her attention 
to Dal. 
River: “I’m deeply sorry, doctor. But, Petras needed an on-hands example of 
self-control. And Petras, I apologize. I hope I never have to follow through 
with that. But this is what I mean by self-control. We are not so different. You
 were stolen from life and made a predator. I was born to be one, raised by 
them to become them. Self-control is important for folks like us. You were an
 easy target. The only one here that stands a chance against me is Astarion and
 only because I will hesitate.”
 Petras: “All right. I’ll bite. But, what else?”
 He said this as he dusted himself off. He wasn’t too happy about that 
demostration of power, but he saw the reason why she is with Astarion. She 
isn’t afraid of him, yet seemed nice. He would make sure to mind his 
behavior around her just in case. 
River: “There is a lot of else. Peace comes only if you work for it. We have to
 fight against people’s perception of us. Self-control of your urges, of your 
bloodlust are of high importance. One of you alone can destroy one 
settlement of 100 people in less than a week. So, your diet needs to be 
vegetarian whenever possible. But, you can’t steal a farmer’s sustenance. Do 
you understand where I’m going with this?”
 Dr. Dalyria: “But to get so many to agree and without a master-… can it even
 be possible? The temptation alone.”
 River: “And this is where you lot come in. We need to create a framework of 
parametes that are doable. Like a set of rules or expectations that need to be 
followed for the sake of the entire group and also consequences when they 
aren’t followed. For example, I tolk Ulma, the Gur leader that if she fails to 
keep her people in check and hurt ours in our territory, then the treaty is off. I 
will take the spawn children back-…”
 Astarion: “Yes, and kill the clan, too. Don’t forget that part.”
River: “Well, consequences. They play nice. We play nice. They fail. I will 
stop playing. So far, they’ve kept their word. I haven’t detected them 
following us even now.”
 Dr. Dalyria: “It is very clear that this is not a simple matter to fix in a few 
hours. I appreciate that you are considering me in the making of this, but I 
think I need to think about it more.”
 Astarion: “Dal, sweetheart, you are welcome to stick around if you’d like. 
Unfortunately, we haven’t finished turning this outpost into something more 
fitting for guests.”
 River: “Sorry, about that by the way. We’re trying to work as fast as possible. 
But, we can try to make it more comfortable. The only thing I cannot allow is
 for you two to reside in the temple above nor for you to feed on our guests or 
hosts. Everything else is fair game.”
 Petras: “Why not above? And who are the guests and hosts?
 River: “The temple above now belongs to the Tiefling Refugees. They 
wouldn’t appreciate two vampire spawn taking up room in their home 
without permission. They are the guests. As for the hosts, the Druids of 
Emerald Grove are the caretakers of this land. The Reaching Woods does 
have an infestaton of gnolls and other beings.”
 Both of them decided to take the offer to rest and think about participating or 
not. River offered to go up and check the light. It was just turning dark, so 
they got a chance to go up and check out the temple and hunt for gnoll. Petras
 kept to them for he was a little afraid that River was not the type to joke 
around or turn a blind eye to killing thinking ones.
 As they went to hunt, Astarion helped River find things in the temple that 
could be used to make them a space of their own down with them. They 
brought both the cart and the wheelborrow to carry things. They got creative 
with the offerings. In the end, it wasn’t much, but they would provide privacy
 and more comfort than at the palace. 
The types of things they got were simple, but useful. They found some rugs, 
chairs, tapestries, and other things. The idea was to offer a table, a chair, and 
a bed. The tapestries were to help cover up the walls to help create a private 
space for them, too. River was very serious about offering them their own 
space with as much comfort as possible.
 By the time they finished hunting, they came back and met with the other 
two. River asked them what they thought about the haul and if they wanted to
 go check out the palace to see if there was anything else they wanted. Petras 
agreed and went quickly. There was still some time before they had to go 
back down. 
River: “Doc, I don’t have clothes to offer, but I can see if the Tieflings sell 
some. I need to go to the Grove in the morning anyway. Would you like that? 
But for tonight, I will be putting up my little tent to serve as a restroom. You 
can bathe there and freshen up. We got water, it’s clean. I’v been collecting it 
form this river and boiling it, too.”
 Dr. Dalyria: “It’s fascinating how you consider all of these little things to 
make life pleasant. Thank you. Yes, if it’s not too much to ask, I’d like a new 
change of clothes.”
 River: “Fantastic. I’ll wash the clothes too. I got to wash ours, too. It won’t 
be a hassle. It can dry over night, and  in the meantime, you can wear a tunic. 
I’ve got lots of those. They will be short, but you can make a list of what sort 
of items you need. I will try my best to get them. Besides, Astarion is paying. 
That’s what big brothers do. Hehehehe.”
 Astarion: “Funny. But, sure. You already gave all your gold to the Tieflings. 
How else would you pay?”
 Petras: “What?! You game them your gold? How much gold did you have? 
Why would you give away your gold?”
 River: “Uh, yes, 1000 gold, and because they were to use it for whatever they
 need to help them. Some wanted to go to Baldur. I adviced against it. I 
suggested here. Many agreed this temple is a better choice.”
Petras asked Astarion directly.
 Petras: “Is she always this extreme? Extremely giving and vicious in an 
instant.”
 Astarion: “She’s worse. She was the one who burned the palace down.”
 Dr. Dalyria: “What? How?”
 River: “Rage. I will erase him and his legacy.”
 Petras: “What did he do to you?”
 River: “To me, nothing directly. To the one I love, everything. That is not 
something I can allow. I will erase that demon from the fabric of existance. 
There will be a day when you lot will not remember the horrors that were 
him. His name will be forgotten.”
 The coldness in her voice was surely unnerving. But her promise caused 
them to understand a little more about her mad plan. What better way to erase
 Cazador Szarr than to prove him wrong. 
Then they finally went back down. And from the corner of her eye, she saw 
two Tiefling scouts hiding. She told them to continue without her for she 
needed to speak to the hidden scouts. They agreed for 3 vampires at night 
weren’t a good thing for anyone. 
River: “Reveal yourselves. I don’t know who it is, but you are behind the tree
 and the other behind pen. Come to me.”
 Her voice wasn’t that of a sweet woman, but rather a stern commander of 
armies. She knew that it was crucial to have them clear the air before letting 
them go home and plant a seed of distrust. 
River: “If I have to go to you, I will drag you both by your horns back to 
Zevlor and Okta for trying to cause a war where there is none. Come to me.”
Rikka came out first. She was a little ashamed, but also scared. The other was
 Toron. He too looked bashful.
 River: “Rikka, Toron. My sweet bebes. Come, come. Let’s walk you back to 
the Grove. Tonight, I will need you to stay put. The Temple is yours, but the 
things inside are for whomever claims them first. I got guests, my sister in 
law and brother in law have found us. I needed some furniture to make the 
living space comfortable. As of now, they are off limits as are you. Tomorrow
 morning or later today, I will come again to speak to the elders about the new
 situation. They arrived today… I suppose the morning. I don’t know. It’s 
difficult to tell time down there. Have you got any questions to ask before I 
leave?”
 Rikka: “No, I mean-… no.”
 Toron just shook his head to say no. She left them both at the gate, gave them
 a hug and headed back.
 As she got back down, she told Astarion and the others that she would need 
to have a new meeting to update them on new happenings. Then she got 
working with them to clean up the furniture pieces and their living spaces. 
River got to figure out how to put up her ‘poop-tent’ for bathing in private. 
She had found a wooden tub that would work for bathing as long as it was a 
stanging shower. 
Once they finished setting up, it wasn’t half bad. They ended up being able to
 hang up the tapestries and some tarps to offer more privacy. They divided the 
space that was to the side of the Arcane Tower into 2 spaces for them. They 
both had a say as to what to put in it. They moved the braziers to the main 
court where the Selune statue was. 
Petras went for a small table and wooden chair. He also got a sort of long 
sofa that he would use as a bit of a bed. Dalyria had a similar set up, but 
River had allowed her to check out the private bedroom to show the bed. She 
agreed, so they used some crates to make her a little bed with some hay to 
add padding and some pelts they found. 
So, they settled in with the tasks. Dalyria washed up and got to wear a tunic. 
Indeed it was a little short for her, but it was fine for now. Petras was next 
and he just wore it as a sort of kilt. 
In the meantime, River washed the clothes they had all worn that day and 
Astarion helped her wring it to make it as dry as possible. Petras helped with 
adding more wood to the fire. Dalyria, finally got her journal back along with
 an ink bottle and a couple of quills in a box. Petras wasn’t interested in 
getting those things himself, but he was curious about the books Gale sent. 
He took the one Astarion had just finished. 
Both he and Dal decided to head into their new living spaces or rooms. 
Astarion and River finally to a chance to wash up themselves. Luckily, River 
had gotten a chance to eat in between tasks, so all she was waiting for was 
time to bathe. 
She got in first and dropped her dirty laundry outside the tent. Astarion 
picked it up and left if soaking. Then he looked up at the new curtain that was
 giving privacy to Petras. Nothing. So, Astarion took off all his clothes and 
stepped in with River. 
He covered her mouth as he stepped in and stood behind her. She gasped 
because he was rather cold. Then he whispered in her ear. 
Astarion: “Tsk Tsk. Lover. Is that anyway to greet your husband.”
 River: “Turn around. I’ll wash your back.”
 They helped each other wash up making light banter about the moment.
They they got their towels on, got rid of their water down the steps, finished 
washing their clothes, hung them and headed of to their bedroom. They 
decided to go in silence as to not disturb his siblings.
 When they got to their room it felt a little warm. Astarion had added candles 
and he had found a metal bed pan where he placed red hot coals to help with 
heat. The reason being that this room was embedded to the rock side, so it 
was rather fresh. Not that she needed it. For some reason she was unusually 
hot. Not as hot as Karlach, but still. 
She got on the bed first and he got in after her. She was next to the wall and 
she turned to face it. Astarion took the opportunity and got her to lay like the 
big spoon-little spoon. She smiled. He didn’t do that often, so she enjoyed it 
when he did. But he held her a little to hard. Then his hand went to cover her 
mouth. 
She stiffened a bit from surprise then relaxed. He used his right leg  to lift 
hers enough to give him free entry. Then she felt him begin to rub between 
her legs on the outside. 
Astarion: “A little help?”
 She rolled her eyes and with her hand, she guided him inside her. Then he let 
his leg down and shifted himself and her to fit better. He held her tighter than 
ever and began to thrust. She began to breathe hard and her hips followed his 
own pace. Her hands held on to his forearm and her nails dug in. He didn’t 
move his arm or his hand. He was trying to stifle her moans as he thrusted 
inside with a little more force than normal. He hadn’t had her this way since 
they started to have sex. 
Though she was loving the roughness, she knew something was bothering 
him. But for now, all she could do was ride it out with him. She couldn’t 
think much when he was hitting all the right places and he was also lost in his
 own passion. He would almost climax, stop, calm down, and start again. He 
must have done it at least five times until he realised that River didn’t have 
his same stamina, so the last time, he finished inside her and finally relaxed. 
The heat coming from her was comforting. Then she grabbed his arm so he 
would hug her and keep him closer still. 
River: “Do you want to talk about it?”
 Astarion: “No.”
 River: “Fine. I love you.”
 Astarion: “I love you, too. Thank you.”
 River: “Mhm.”
 She finally fell asleep. He held on to her and sniffed her hair. He squeezed 
her tighter. The arrival of his siblings finally dawned on him. Things would 
speed up from here. His mind was betraying him.
 What the fuck is going to happen now? Will I be able to keep this one safe?
 She’s bloody mad! She’s living with three vampires and what does she do? 
She washes their nickers! Does she know just how much danger she’s in? 
And how are we going to build those bungalows? Then we have the 
problem of rules. Can Petras even handle himself. Self-control, for 7,000 
spawn. We will surely need divine intervetion.
 River: “Do you want to talk about it or do you just want to keep spiraling 
alone? Your call.”
 Astarion: “Fine. I’ll stop the spiral.”
 River: “We will talk about what’s eating at you later then.”
 Astarion: “Fine. 
River: “Besides, we spiral together.”
 He laughed and kissed her head. They were in this together. 
After a couple of hours of privacy, the home began to stir. Dalyria went to get
 her now dry clothes from the clothes line. She then returned to her now room 
to get dressed. She stayed there for a while longer. Now that she has her 
journal back, she was busy filling it up. 
Petras, too. He went for his clothes, but decided to dress there. Lucky for 
him, he was along for a while. Once dressed, for the first time, he decided to 
pick up a broom and began to sweep. 
Meanwhile, River finally got Astarion to open up about last night.
 River: “Talk to me, love. What was that last night? I am not mad. I’m just 
worried. We haven’t done that in a long time. Talk to me.”
 Astarion: “I am sorry. The thing is that it finally got real. Too real. Their 
arrival just landed heavy on my mind. Next thing I know, there will be more, 
and I don’t know if I-…”
 River: “You’re still worried about them going feral and trying to kill me? 
Worse that they manage it? I’m not going to lie, I share your fear. That said, 
the same can be said about anything and anyone. I fear the same for you, 
more than I do for myself, but you know that.”
 Astarion: “I don’t want to lose you, but what else can we do? I sent them 
here, but they need guidance. And you are doing all you can to make them 
comfortable, which is clever. Win them over to gain protectors.”
 River: “Exactly, but at the same time, I do need to provide them with proper 
living spaces. I can live in a hole in the ground, but my bebes never. NEVER!
 They are people not creatures.”
 Astarion: “I hope they see it that way. We were trapped for so long. I think 
that even Petras is struggling with the notion that I’m not trying to be their 
master. Dal is more willing, but I know that both are struggling with the idea 
of you.”
 River: “Me? What did I do?”
 Astarion: “So much for so little.”
River: “Not little. I gain so much. I gain a larger family and a community. It’s
 scary, sure. But, I’m also happy and excited.”
 Astarion: “My mad love. I guess, I will simply need to go with your flow.”
 She laughed at his bad pun. She loved puns and dad jokes, especially when 
they came from him. He was terrible at them. As they laughed and joked, 
they got ready for the day. They had a lot of things to do today. But first, she 
needed something to eat. 
They walked by the new ‘livingroom’ for they had been able to collect some 
comfortable padded chairs which had been kept in a locked room. Astarion 
was able to unlock it and they figuret the goblins never bothered with it. So, 
the things were in very good condition, but dusty. 
Once in the kitchen, River had to catch herself when considering portions. 
She was the only one to eat. As she ate her food, which was dry meat and dry 
fruits in her tea. She began to plan the day with Astarion. Petras finally put 
the broom down and joined them. The exchanged pleasantries and then Dal 
finally showed  up with a list.
 After all, River did ask for a list of items Dal would need. Petras would join 
in the resqusets. As for Astarion, he jus thad to take it. He was the  one with 
coin.
