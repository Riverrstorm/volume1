CHAPTER 16- In the shadows
 After a couple of hours they were rested and content. They stayed in bed for 
an hour more, just enjoying the company and rubbing legs and feet together.
 “Astarion, the farm roof sort of covers enough to give some shade, you 
know.”
 “Mh-… Perhaps we should step out for a little while.”
 “I was thinking the same thing. Gives you a chance to get a tan like me.”
 He laughed. But he would need to wear his special gear just for good 
measure. It was fine, though. It would feel like real camping with both of 
them outside. 
So, once again, they continued their home routine: wash up, get dressed, pick
 up the pelts, and all those little things.
 Then Tav went outside to go scavange for wood, while he stayed back to 
build a rock circle for a fire. Today that it was still daytime, there was no 
issue with making one. Besides, the roof would help dissipate the smoke a 
little. 
When Tav returned, she had wood and some apples. She’d found a little 
orchard and had take some. This time, since there was no fencing or any 
detail that it was a claimed land, she left no coin. She was just merrily 
returning with her little cart and an apple in her mouth. 
He enjoyed seeing her enjoying herself like that, especially now that it 
seemed to be so quiet. The sun was not at it’s highest point, so it seemed to 
be about 10 am. 
Even with his dark glasses, he could see that it was a sight to behold. The 
river was to the west and you could hear the barges and water splashing. The 
smells of fish and other plant matter was strong. This was the reason Tav 
prefered to follow the river. It indeed hide vampire musk in the land of the 
Companions. 
As for the grasslands, they were also a sight to behold. Long grass and unkept
 ground. Some scattered ruins here and there even up to the distance getting 
closer to the edge of the Reaching Woods. Even the woods look particularly 
pleasant, hiding all the perils that were waiting for them. Despite that, it was 
nice out. The air was crisp and it wasn’t too hot, yet. 
When Tav arrived, she pushed the little cart near Astarion so he could build 
the fire. She could do it, buy why? He could do it, too. Besides, she went 
inside to get her food and water. She was hungry despite the apple. 
“So, my moon, are you feeling peckish today?”
 “To be honest, I’m fine at the moment. I thought I might, but no.”
“Oh, that’s great. Then-… could you help me with-…”, she said shyly before 
he stopped her. 
He made a face, but he was still willing to help. He just thought it was messy.
 By now he wondered if he was a rogue or a hunter, a ranger, like her. She had
 taught him a lot of things of how to survive in the wilds. To her it was a 
typcial day, but to him it was still a bit disgusting.
 “All of it?”, he said hoping it was not a lot of work what  she wanted.
 “No, just the fleece. I know you don’t like the skinning, but I don’t need it. I 
just want the wool to make us some socks. It might be cold in the Underdark 
or something.”
 He bursted out laughing. The thought of this one making him socks to keep 
him warm.
 Seriously woman, do you even remember what I am? I’m a vampire with 
wooly socks to keep warm in the cold. You’re too good to me.
 He continued, “Sounds like a plan. I wouldn’t want to get cold. Thank you.”, 
he said this in is most polite posh voice.
 She didn’t realize that her logic wasn’t there for she saw him as a man, not a 
curse. Perhaps that’s why she adapted to him so easily. It was just things to 
do for her. But he was as normal as anybody in her mind. 
She proceeded to make her meal once the fire was ready and as she ate, he 
took a sharp knife to remove the fleece. Then she would handle the carcass 
by taking to the last place she left the other body. 
An just like that, they spent the day. At one point she convinced Astarion to 
stick around as she tried calling their friends. Gale answered in no time, 
cutting his class presentation short. Wyll and Karlach found a quieter spot 
themselves to chat and tease Astarion about being a house-husband. Lae’Zel 
and Minthara even said more than hello. The only one that couldn’t talk for 
too long was Shadowheart. She was feeling a bit sick, morning sickness it 
seemed. Tav was through the moon. She got to catch up with her beloved 
family and was hopeful that once at the Grove, she might catch up with 
Halsin, Minsk, and Jaheira. She didn’t know where they were, but the forest 
might be keeping them safe. 
Astarion finished his work and then sharpened his blade, and for the rest of 
the day time, they simply chatted about old adventures or stayed in silence 
hearing the noises coming from the river. No more gnolls were heard during 
day time. 
Then they took out the map to get an idea of where to head next. They 
figured they’d need about one more camp until they got into the woods. But, 
by then, due to the trees, no more tent. Astarion was a little thrilled about 
that. It did get a little claustrophobic at times for him. 
So the hours passed slowly but very fast. When they least expected it, the sun
 had set, Astarion had been able to enjoy it under the shade of the delapidated 
roof and then the tent and all their presence was gone. Tav stuffed the sheep’s
 fleece in a bag and placed it inside the her void of nicknacks with some salt 
and cinnamon she saved for special occasions. They were set and they were 
gone.
 The only difference this time was that they no longer had to pretend they 
were frail for any bigotted Champion of Elturgard. Tonight, they were back 
to being a vampire rogue and his mate, the wood-elf ranger huntress. They 
were heading to the woods, no less. That’s where she thrived. They would be 
fine.
 As they had the freedom to move this time, they were able to move much 
faster to the point they simply decided to lift the packed cart up to move 
faster on the rugged terrain. Poor Helen’s wheels just spinned slowly as their 
running bounce moved her along. For the first time, Helen felt like she was 
flying. She wasn’t, she was just not touching the ground. 
They didn’t talk much while the moved, but it was because of the bugs. It 
was a little difficult for Tav to keep up, so Astarion just adjusted his speed to 
match hers better. Either way,  they made a pretty good run. They were much
 closer. When they saw the sky start to change colors, they repeated their 
routine. This time, though they were not near the river. They had moved 
closer to the nearest edge of the forest. It was less likely for palandins or 
hellriders to be near this land. Gnolls on the other hand were a different story.
 In the darkness of the fields, they could smell them lurking. They heard 
noises, too. But they weren’t afraid. Tav had her bow and quiver on her at all 
times now, and Astarion was also on high alert. 
Tav had baked her pototaoes and yams before hand, so they didn’t need to 
make a fire. And the weather was still not too bad. She could manage the 
temperature drops at night, but during day time it was no trouble at all. 
So, another camp came and went. Rinse and repeat. By now, the were on the 
night of the second day. This time, they would make it to the forest. The 
smell of the trees and the moist dirt was now more noticeable. Tav breathed a
 sigh of relief she didn’t know she was holding. Though this was not a forest 
she had spend much time in before, to her most forests were pretty similar. 
“Astarion, we’re entering the outskirts. I’d like to rest up there. Can you help 
me with the things. We’ll hang.”
 “Hang? What do you mean?
 “Tie the packs with rope, hang the things from the thickest branch. Also, tie 
my Helen and hang her, too. We’ll wait a couple of hours up there. Then, go 
down and keep moving. I just need a couple of hours.”
 “Very well then. To be honest, I never imagined how you’d manage life in a 
forest. I guess it’s time for me to find out. See if I like it.”
 She laughed for she knew he wouldn’t. No true comforts unless you were a 
bit more wild-… a bit more feral. 
“Well, I’d be surprised if you liked it a little. It’s not going to be comfortable 
for you, but I have to rest. Sorry. I’ll be good soon enough. I hate running.”
 So, they did just that. She found a good set of trees to hang the camp items to 
keep animals from getting in them. She found a sturdy branch and she lay 
there to fall asleep for a while. It was rather cool, but the weather was still not
 letting snow in. 
As for Astarion, he decided to go scout the land. He wasn’t interested in 
sitting in a branch while Tav slept. So, he decided it was a good time to 
search for a little snack. 
While Astarion left for his little stroll, Tav asked him to mark the bark with 
bag of poultice. He’d have to basically create distracting scent trails to mess 
with gnoll trackers. As he did that, Tav, before taking her nap, lathered up 
some throwing needles with a mix of the same poultice and meat from the 
sheep Astarion killed. She threw the needles all around where she could hit 
some trees at a distance. Her hope was to warn the gnolls that there was a 
vampire lingering around, but confuse the trackers on the direction said 
vampire was moving towards or away from. 
Now she rested. She was still on high alert for any forest forced you to stay in
 hypervigilence. Her bow was on her lap and her dagger on her hand. Even at 
rest, she was deadly.
 Meanwhile, Astarion chose to move through the trees, climbing and jumping 
at first. He wanted to have his scent marked up high to then go down and 
start following Tav’s request. 
He moved like a shadow, mixing with those found in the forest. He could 
smell the trees and dirt, but there was a fain rotten odor, a little like old blood
 and decay. There were gnolls in this forest. He’d already snacked on one, but 
he wouldn’t mind on another or two. 
He was on the prowl now. He’d covered a good distance from where Tav was
 and left a buffer of 10 meters without any scent marking other than his own 
scent. If he got lucky, any movement would lead to him and not to her. But 
he wasn’t worried about her. He thought the forest should worry that she’d 
wake in a bad mood. She burned a Cazador’s Palace down with two words 
already and that was made of stone. He didn’t want to imagine what would 
happen here that it was basically a giant pile of wood. So, he kept moving by 
making a right turn going north. He was having fun tracking dogs.
 Then he got what he was looking for.
 “Oh, hello.”, he said to no one. 
In the distance 15 ahead he saw a group of them, 5. Three young and two old 
gnolls. Their look was as gross as their scent. By now it was twilight again. It
 would soon be daytime. If Astarion wanted to have his fun, he’d need to 
move fast.  Besides, by now, he’d been gone at least two hours.
 As Tav slept, occasionally her ears will flicker. This wasn’t the deep sleep 
she achieved in the tent with Astarion. Right now it was more of a light night.
 Then she heard something. She opened her eyes, grabbed her bow, and 
moved to stand. It took seconds to clear her mind and focus.
 Down below, there was a rabbit running for dear life, yet a little furter she 
saw one of those damn dogs. Her hand just reached back into her quiver and 
let her muscle memory do the rest. 
There was a young gnoll running after the poor animal. Tav took a big wiff of
 the air. It was potent, but she figured this one, being young, was alone. Too 
bad. 
The arrow pierced through the air making a swish sound. Then a crack and 
thud. The rabbit was gone. She put her bow behind her and grabbed her 
daggers again. She used them to climb down quickly withouth needing to 
jump. 
She ran towards the body and scavanged anything useful. Then she took out 
her oil vial and poured some of it. She took her arrow and checked it. It 
would work again. Then she cast her spell. The body burned while she went 
back another tree with the help of her daggers. She was now a sentry, making
 sure the fire wouldn’t spread beyond the kill. It was a habit of hers, all kills 
would burn. Ashes to ashes, and all that. 
But then, she heard more noice behind her. This one wasn’t alone. She might 
need to fight alone this time. But perhaps not. She made a calculated guess, if
 she managed it, she might be able to jumpt to the nearest tree and stick to it 
with her daggers. She had to think fast or her hanging camp would be found. 
As she decided her next move, Astarion was playing with his food. He had 
eaten recently and had drank her blood in the morning, too. He sort of felt a 
bit bad about that, but Tav insisted on increasing his feeding to ensure he 
would be at his peak while in the forest. It would be his first time in this sort 
of hostile territory while being only with her. She needed his mind clear and 
his claws and fangs sharp. Basically, this city dweller needed to be on top of 
his game in her domain. She knew she could manage even with less blood.
He’d found the gnoll camp with them grunting. He went down the tree he 
was on and began to circle them. He was gaging as much as he could, before 
the attack. So, he used some tricks he’d learned from her. First it was 
deception. He took a little rock and threw it hard. It hit a tree 5 meters from 
their camp. Then took another and threw it a little over. Basically, twelve 
o’clock and three o’clock in direction. Then he moved left and circled the 
trees.
 He was making sure to step as softly as possible, then he climbed up. The 
poor gnolls were disoriented. They could smell him, but couldn’t pin point 
his location. At first they moved towards the first rock, but then half way they
 split to go to the second rock. But the wind carried Astarion’s scent, just like 
he intended. 
Astarion could smell the fear in their rot. He knew and they knew, a vampire 
is a much stronger foe than five of them together. Then Astarion heard a 
whistle, a sort of dog whistle. Games were over. Time to go home. 
The gnolls hear it too but had no idea what it was and with the fear of the 
vampire scent, they decided to stay put. Astarion moved like a shadow back 
to the camp. He knew Tav needed help. She was awake now and likely the 
camp was compromised. It would take a while for him to get there. She’d 
have to hold on.
Tav moved higher on the tree to scout it better and saw a large one sniffing 
the air. She couldn’t use her bow here. But, perhaps she could take it down if 
she went back down. 
She decided it was all or nothing. Down she went, cutting open the bark with 
her blades as she went. She landed with a soft thud. Then took off running. 
She flanked right opposite the large gnoll. It finally caught her scent clearly. 
It hadn’t smelled one of those in a long while. It snarled its teeth in delight. 
So, did she. She was near enough to see its face. The dog saw her and 
launched forward. She saw it, and jumped and climbed the tree. She went 
around the trunk and landed on the other side. It turned around to get at her 
again. This time she didn’t move. She wanted it to get near.
 Her daggers dug at its torso first. The metallic scent of its blood dripping now
 down her hand. The dog snapped at her, but she kicked it off. It staggered 
backwards. She went after it it again, dagger in hand. The crack of its skull 
made a sickening sound. With her other hand she stabbed it again in the gut. 
It was as if she had no control of her rage. The poor thing was dead and it 
didn’t know it yet. Then she got behind it and she sliced open its throat. She 
was not herself then. She couldn’t see it was dead, yet her body kept slicing it
 open. Her chest heaving. Her eyes wild. Her ears searching for more. 
She turned around. There was a noise. She was on the hunt. She was getting 
ready to take off for more. Then she stopped dead on her tracks.
 “Tav! Stop!”, she heard a familiar voice and she snapped out of it. 
She ran towards the direction of the voice as she placed her daggers back. 
Then she waited at the bottom of the tree. Astarion climbed down.
 “Just what in the hells was that?!”, he said trying not to shout.
 “It woke me up.”
 Astarion rolled his eyes. He lost 5 snacks because this one indeed woke up 
cranky. 
“I swear woman. Come on, let’s go. We’ve made too much noice. It’s time.”
 “Yes. Sorry. I’ll make it up to you, my love.”, said Tav in a shy whisper. 
They went back to the tree and moved everything down quickly. Then 
packed the cart and once again carried her away heading north. The location 
was still relatively clear; the Emeral Grove.  Tav was excited to be back 
there. She was very ready to tell the Tieflings about her plan to make a little 
town. 
Astarion noticed her increased speed, so he adjusted his step. It wouldn’t be 
long until they reached the Grove. As for the gnoll patrols, they both knew 
they were lurking, but both Tav and Astarion were moving too quickly to 
match a common victim. It was wise for the gnolls to accept that something 
as fast as them in the forest could only mean trouble. 
Then he began to take notice of the area as they ran. They were almost there. 
But, that also meant that it was getting to be daylight in a couple of minutes. 
They might not make it just, yet. 
Very winded, Tav tried her best to speak.
 “Astarion? It’s day soon. We have to plan.”
 “Oh, Tav. You sound dreadful, but yes. We seem to need the beak anyway.”
 They slowed down to a trot and then stopped all together. They placed the 
cart down, too. She looked around, still hypervigilant about the area. He 
seemed more relaxed, but was too on the look out. 
“Let’s see. How about your protective gear? That would make me more 
relaxed. I think you know we’re almost there.”
 “Hmm-… I agree, but I don’t have to like it. I’ll have to dig it out.”
 “It’s in my pack. The glasses are rolled in my cotton tunic, the orange one.”
 He began looking for his things in her void bag. She continued.
 “So, I’m thinking of this. Tell me what you think. I go in first. Get them to 
remember me first. Then have them open the gate a little and I’ll go in with 
the cart running. You stay in the shade. Then I run back with a pelt and 
conver you. Then we run inside and head to a shaded space. I mean, what 
else can I do? I don’t how how they have it set up right now.”
 Astarion thought about it. He hated having to wait and hide, but they both 
knew that it was safer for them to be inside the grove. Besides, he could hunt 
at night without having to open the gate. That was just a curtesy for the 
people inside. He could easily climb the walls and Tav was crazy enough to 
find a way inside, too. But, it wasn’t their home, yet. He had a feeling Tav’s 
mind was already working double time with her machinations. She had that 
look in her eyes. 
“I think it’s the best way if we are to come in  peace.”, he finally said.
 “I mean, if you can add or-…”, she said a bit worried.
 “No, I agree. We don’t have a lot of options lest we wait until dark and I 
much rather have you inside tonight.”
 “Very well. Shall we go?”
 “Of course.”
 She saw how her hand was now red with red welts on her skin, but she was 
almost there, so it was fine for now. He saw it too, but he knew that she was 
like an arrow now. She would not be stopped now. He just kept up with her 
speed. 
And then they finally saw the clearing and the pathway up the closed gate. 
She removed her bow and quiver and left them in the cart. Then she decided 
to change clothes. She removed her top, leather pants and boots for her white 
tunic and sandals. She thougt of this as her “I’m not dangerous” look. She 
had seen some people at a healing temple that wore this often. Her logic 
seemed solid. 
Astarion gave her a smile while wearing his own sort of ‘uniform’. He had 
his cloak, gloves, and glasses to help minimize sun exposure, while she had 
her white tunic and sandals. This time, she decided to wear no weapons. She 
was completely exposed and at their mercy. She really hoped they 
remembered her. 
She looked like a surreal being escaping the morning mist of the forest, 
almost like a ghost or a goddess. Her tunic contrasting with her bronze skin. 
Her unruly hair, but her giant smile. She was excited. It was difficult to walk 
up slowly. 
‘Halt! Who goes there?!”, said one of the guards.
 She recognized him, it was Roland. He was guarding the wall this morning. 
She began waving her hand to say hello.
 “Is that you Roland?!”
“What in the hells?, how do you know my name? Who are you?”, said he.
 “It’s me Tav! Remember me? Last time I came with more people! But it’s 
just 2 of us now.”, she said excitedly.
 There was another at the wall that got the attention of Roland, so he stepped 
back out of sight. It was Toron who remembered Tav and the gang, too.  
Toron peaked over to see her down bellow. 
“Tav! Welcome back! Where are the others?”
 “Well, I’ve got the one with me, but the others are all over Faerun.”, she 
laughed at this.
 “Very well. Let me open the gate.”, said Toron.
 “Yes, but only a little. Just give me a minute.”, she signaled them to stop.
 She took of running back to Astarion. She gave him a quick kiss on the lips 
and took the cart. She ran back up with her jingling cart. Helen seemed to be 
singing with all the clashing of the metal on metal. Then Tav appeared back 
at the gate. 
“Remember, just a little way. Not all of it.”, she shouted.
 They did as she suggested. She left the cart a little to the side and the people 
were now taking notice. They were gathering. Then she directed her attention
 to the guards again. 
“Astarion is still out there. But, he needs the shadows. I will need you to open
 up a little again. I will run to him with extra cover. Then we’ll run back and 
he’ll flank right to that tree’s cover. Understood? Then I’ll tell you all the 
story. I’m so excited to be back!”, she said with a smile and pelt at her hands.
 “All right, miss. Get ready, then.”
 As soon as they opened the gate, she took off and got to him in no time. She 
placed the thick pelt on him and she took running. Since it was still early 
morning now, the sun was not right on top. It was more to the east, so was 
relatively safe for now. Then once both were in, the gate shut with a noisy 
thud. And Astarion turned right to go under the tree’s shade. 
So, old friends got a chance to catch up in the most recent happenings and 
talked about what the other members were up to. By then, they had been 
helped with putting uptheir tent back up next to the tree’s shade. Like this 
Astarion could stay outside for a bit longer. 
This first day, they decided that it would be best to take it as a planning day. 
They didn’t know what to expect once they went to the gobling camp again, 
especially the inside to the temple. 
By now, the sun was right on top, so it was around noon. Luckily, the tree top
 they were using for shelter was holding quite well for Astarion. He kept the 
glasses on per Tav’s request as she always got nervous if the sun was at full 
brightness and he was having to be outside. He oblidged to help her focus on 
presenting her plan. He knew she was passionate about this and really wanted
 to make a great impression. He could even feel the same excitement in 
himself, but he also thought it was just because she was really giving off that 
aura of hopefulness. 
So, she went of with Okta and Roland to invite other people back down to the
 gate to listen to her proposal. Surprisingly enough, plenty of them agreed to 
go and see what was going on. They even set up a little tent to provide 
additional shade. They even brought over snacks and drink. It seemed to be 
turning into a little parthy rather than a serious meeting. But Tav prefered that
 to make it easier for her to talk.
 “Hello and well met, my dear friends! It has been a while since we saw each 
other last. The last time you all offered your shelter to us, we were more, but 
today it’s just myself and Astarion.”
 Astarion lifted his hand to greet them, but said nothing. He didn’t like the 
attention on him. He wasn’t sulking or broody, but he was not showing the 
same enthusiasm as Tav was.
 Then one of the tiefling kids said, “Why is he hiding in the shadows this 
time? Last time he was out and about.”
Tav took care of it. 
“Well, Mol, you see last time we were here, we were on a mission to destroy 
the nether brain. That thing had placed a parasite inside our heads and that 
parasite allowed Astarion to move in the light of the sun. But we achieved 
our objetive about a month ago, so the parasite is dead. As a result, he cannot 
walk in the sun light anymore.”
 Mol’s face was that of shock wondering what that meant. That is until Danis 
hit him with his elbow and told him that Astarion is a vampire and to stop 
interrupting with stupid questions. They knew enough of the gang of 
champions by now that Astarion being a vampire shouldn’t be a shock.
 Danis: “You know he’s a vampire, Mol. Don’t be stupid. Besides, he won’t 
hurt us. She feeds him.
 Mol: “Oh, yeah! Sorry, I had forgotten.”
 Danis just rolled his eyes at him, feeling smug that he corrected his friend. 
Tav: “That is very true Danis. Thank you for your clarification. Indeed what 
you say is true. Is there anyone here that wants to ask a question or express 
their feelings about this fact? I need us all to be clear about the situation 
before I start with my-… our reason for being here.”
 She turned around to look at Astarion to give him a smile. Then she 
continued.
 Tav: “I vouch for him. He never attacked any of the people here when you all
 asked for our aid against the goblins. And he won’t do it now.”
 Then in a booming voice coming from the just opened gate, a large handsome
 bronze man shouted while wearing a large smile.
 Halsin: “And I vouch for them both. They are friends of the Grove and also 
their protectors, too.”
 Tav: “Halsin! You’re here! That’s fantastic! Oh, I missed you, so!”
 She went to meet him and give him a large hug. He met her enthusiasm, too. 
Halsin: “So, you’ve finally made it to the Grove, you too.”
 Tav: “Yes, it took a bit. But, now I get the feeling-… did you know we were 
coming?”
 She closed her eyes enough to look like she was on to him. But Halsin 
laughed it off, but he did try to slily look at Astarion and gave him a wink. 
Tav let it go. Whatever those two were on about, wasn’t her business now.
 Astarion remembered back at the tavern in Baldur’s Gate, right before he left 
that Halsin pulled him aside. 
Halsin: “Astarion, can I talk to you for a moment?”
Astarion: “About?”
 Halsin made a move with his head pointing towards a sleeping Tav on a chair
 being help up by Karlach.
 Astarion: “Very well.”
 They both moved away from the group and went to an opposite corner to get 
a bit more privacy. They found a little table tucked away and sat down. 
Halsin: “So, what are you planning to do now that you can’t walk in the 
sun?”
 Astarion: “I’m going to the underdark and find the other spawns. I suppose 
they’ll need some guidance.”
 Halsin: “And what about Tav?”
 Astarion: “What about Tav? She can do as she pleases. She’s a big girl.”
 Halsin: “You know what I mean, Astarion. Though you both pretend to not 
know the truth, the rest of us know what’s going on with you, too.”
 Astarion: “How dare you come to me and tell me the obvious? Besides, 
what’s it to you?”
 Halsin: “I’m looking out for you both. But, I must admit that I am going to 
shoot my shot if you keep pretending she’s just your friend. She deserves 
more than the scraps you’re managing to throw her way.”
 Astarion looked away a bit shameful, but he knew Halsin was right. Tav was 
really trying to make sure Astarion knew she cared for him, but he was still 
scared of letting her get too close. He had to accept that he was having 
trouble not feeling like he was using her for protection, but at the same time 
she was growing on him. He had to accept he indeed was falling in love.
 Astarion: “Why is it that all of you desire her so?”
 Halsin: “You know why. Every one has something they have really enjoyed 
about her. She came from nowhere and she gives her love so freely. She is 
caring and her joy is infectious. That’s not even half of it, but I know that 
even Minthara would like to have her. Scary thought, but you know what I 
mean.”
 Astarion: “Unfortunately, I do. She’s been sneaking around Tav’s tent 
whenever I’m there.”
 Halsin laughed. He knew that at this point, despite Astarion trying his best to 
find private places to make love to Tav, somehow there was always someone 
from the group showing up, making no noise, staying a little too long, and 
then try to leave quietly before he finished having sex with her. He was just 
grateful Tav was too distracted that she hadn’t really noticed. 
Halsin: “That’s what I mean. By now, we all know she is in love with you 
while pretending she isn’t. She does it for you per your request. I know that 
you are still dealing with your past, but it is unfair for you to keep her on a 
short leash while you pretend you are just friends. That’s a lie and it’s unfair 
to her and to you.”
 Astarion: “So, you want me to declare my love for her or you will begin to 
pursue her interest? I think she won’t give you the time of day.”
 Halsin: “Well, it won’t be only me. I don’t mind sharing.”
 Astarion: “How dare you?! She is not a thing to be shared with anyone. I 
won’t allow it. She’s mine!”
 Halsin laughed again. He finally achieved his true goal. He pushed him to 
accept his feelings about her. Though Halsin did like Tav and would love to 
make her his woman, he also knew that Tav and Astarion were in love. They 
just needed a little push to accept it instead of trying their best to hide it. 
They had been fooling no one for months. 
Halsin: “There you go. I knew you had it in you. May I suggest that you take 
the long way to the Underdark with her? It will give you a chance to really 
get to know each other and see if you can make it work. That is, before you 
head into more difficult territory.”
 Astarion looked at him with surprise. It was a great plan. Tav didn’t know 
Baldur’s Gate well enough to know that they could go into the Underdark via
 the sewer system. But the idea was grand. It would solidify his own thoughts 
on having a mortal woman become his bride and all that. 
Astarion: “You’re right. I think that would be a great idea.”
 Halsin: “And you can reach the Grove before you go into the Underdark. I’m 
sure she’ll love seeing the people there after the trip.”
Astarion: “Well, Halsin. I will take you up on your offer. And I’ll really 
apreciate it if you don’t try to persue Tav. Like I said, she is mine.”
 Halsin stoop up while laughing to himself. He was glad he was able to push 
Astarion into honesty, yet was  quite surprised Astarion was so willing to 
accept a suggestion regarding his own love life. But, then again, everyone 
knew those two would end up together, except them.
 Coming back to the present, Astarion smiled while he remembered this 
conversation. He was rather annoyed at Halsin for interfereing, but now 
understood that it was likely a conversation the group had regarding him and 
Tav. They all knew it back then from the very start. 
As he was lost in thought, Tav continued with her presentation to the people 
she was also claiming as her people. It was becoming obvious that she took 
those who had no place in Faerun. She too was like them, unwanted, but she 
was intent on forcing Faerun to make space for her and her clan. She was 
quickly growing the members of it, too. 
Tav: “No questions then? Very well. We have come here because about 4 
months ago, now, we freed victims of a vampire lord named Cazador Szarr. 
He was living in Baldur’s Gate and due to the size of the city, he was able to 
capture 7,000 people and kill just as many if not more”
The tieflings stirred as they have been gearing up to walk and ask for assylum
 at Baldur’s Gate. Tav realized the fear this had spread across their faces. 
Then she continued.
 Tav: “Now, I am awere that this news are simply horrible to hear. I agree. 
But, let me continue before you begin to make asumptions or ask questions. 
Please, allow me to continue.”
 Halsin had to step in and calm the group for her to continue.
 Tav: “Right then. The champions and I headed to the palace to kill this 
vampire lord and thus free the victims under his control. These people, this 
new kind of people, cannot make more vampires. They don’t have the 
possibility to spread their curse, yet they are burdened to carry it. That palace 
was destroyed along with the helpers of Cazador. Now, the victims were 
allowed to go in the cover of night and head to the Underdark.”
 The people’s faces went from bad to worse as she continued, but she needed 
to finish. She pushed on.
 Tav: “The reason is obvious, they will be away from sunlight. Our goal is to 
go into the Underdark, find as many as we can and talk to them just like I am 
doing with you now.”
Now the folks were confused.
 Locke: “What does that have to do with us? You aren’t planning on bringing 
them here, are you?”
 Tav: “Well, no. You live in the light. They can’t. But no. Let me now say 
where my most important point is.”
 Locke didn’t’ look to assured, but he had to allow her to finish.
 Tav: “I’ve been taking counsil with the champions and thinking about 
possibilities, and I think I have an offer that could work for all of us. I beg 
that you listen with an open mind. My goal is to benefit all of us. So, the offer
 is this; Let’s take back the woods. Let’s not go to Baldur’s Gate. Let’s fortify 
this place. Let’s expand our permiter. Let’s fix the broken. Let’s make this 
our home and stand firm. These woods have been the druids for ages. Now, 
you, tieflings, have been pushed out of other cities unjustly, so let’s reclaim a
 land that is now righfully yours. Let us help reclaim this land and work 
together to create a save heaven for those that are looking for a place to 
belong. We all deserve a place to live, to love, to learn, and to thrive. 
Besides, even though we are inside the zealous Elturgard, this woods have 
been avoided by the palandins and the hellriders for ages. That becomes a 
safety for us. They stay on their side and we can continue to thrive on ours. 
We can even become the next large settlement that can economically 
compete with even Elturgard or Berdusk.”
She completed her speech here lest she continued to ramble and confuse 
them. She surely dropped a bomb on them. It was a lot to thing of. 
Then Halsin, looking rather serious, spoke first. 
Halsin: “That is certainly a lot to take in. But, may I ask what does that have 
to do with the spawn?”
 Tav: “I want to offer the same thing to them. The distance between both 
settlements gives us an advantage.”
 Halsin: “That is a truly mad plan, Tav. Even for you, but I’ve fought beside 
you enough to know this wasn’t just a fleeting thought for you, was it?”
 Tav: “Indeed, you are correct. I want to offer my bow to serve you all. I had 
no home for most my life. You were robbed from yours. My desire is to force
 Faerun to make space for all of us. People like him, liky my beloved 
Astarion, have been cursed and now they have nowhere to go. And you guys 
were cursed with something different, but you were also forced to not belong.
 We will force Faerun’s people to accept us. We exist. We belong. And we 
deserve to have a home.”
 This caught the attention of the people. It was working. It wasn’t so much her
 plan, but rather her conviction and passion. Here was this woman who was 
vowing her life to them, the refugees, simply  because she herself didn’t 
belong to any clan. She was willing to risk her life to fight for a place to 
belong. This was not something they’d expect in a thousand years. 
Then the eldest of the tiefling spoke.
 Okta: “Young lady, when you were here before, it took little convincing for 
you to help us. We had little to offer yet you rallied your friends to help us. 
And now, after taking on a difficult feat and succeeding, you chose to come 
back and help again. You could be with your love some place enjoying your 
time, yet you are here to offer an outrageous plan. And all for what? To give 
us a  home. Just who are you, dear? If I didn’t know any better, I would 
surely think you’ve been sent by a divine to help us.”
 The woman laughed, but she helped her people see Tav in a different 
perspective. Perhaps she was divine or perhaps she was some random nobody
 who had crazy ideas and had the mind to push them into reality.
 Tav: “Well, I am no divine. I’m simply a person who lost her clan years ago 
and is fighting Faerun to get one back. So, what do you say? Are you daring 
enough to fight against Faerun to make space for us? Or do you wish to 
continue to go to Baldur’s closed gates to people like us?”
 Halsin: “Your arguments are surely valid, but I think it is best to really think 
about this before giving a sure answer.”
 Tav: “I completely agree. Also, as a show of trust, I offer my gains, too. In 
the past year, I’ve worked different odd jobs and made a little over a 
thousand gold. It’s all I have, but I don’t need coin. I live of the land. So, I 
offer my coin to help. I offer this with no strings attached. Whether you 
accept my offer or decide to continue the journey to Baldru’s Gate, the coin 
is yours. Whatever help it may bring is a blessing I give thee.”
 She handed the bag of gold to Okta, the matriarch of this group. This cuased 
a stir for no one gives that much for nothing in return. But what they didn’t 
know was that Tav had learned that you can change people’s opinions when 
you show that you are willing to lose more than what you can “gain”. 
She could make the money back. But using this could help tip the scales in 
her favor. Besides, Astarion still had his bag and he had more than she did. 
They could use his coin if needed to help the spawn. 
Halsin then invited the people to go back to their chores and tents to allow 
them to “ferment” what was discussed. He suggested they thought up of any 
questions or arguments for either tonight or tomorrow morning. Tav gave 
him a thankful look for she was ready to rest for the next couple of hours. 
Astarion went inside the tent and Tav followed. 
Tav: “By the gods! That took a lot from me! I’m still shaky, look.”
 She showed him the ligth shake of her hands due to the adrenaline coursing 
through her vains. He smiled. He was in awe of her power and grace. 
Astarion: “Come here my love.”
 He tought it was best for her to finally rest. She had been awoken by gnolls 
back in the last camp site. She was about to crash. So, she did as she was told
 and snuggled beside him. Then her world went dark. 
As she slept happily and safe, due to the proximity of her next big plan, her 
mind forced her to remember her last meeting of sorts.
 Wyll: “Are you sure this is a good idea, Tav?”
 Tav: “No, but they aren’t mine to keep either. Not now at least.”
 Astarion: “I understand, but I am also worried, which is surprising.”
 Tav: “Well, if any of you guys has a better idea, I’m all for it. Otherwise, the 
children must go back to their family.”
 She was dreaming of what happened right before the spawn took off to the 
Underdark. The Gur children needed to be handed over to Ulma. Wyll and 
Karlach helped Tav speak with the spawn children about the plan: they were 
to go back home under the promise that their family would take care of them 
despite their new form. Tav was very uncertain of handing them over as was 
Wyll, but they still needed to handle the parasites. They had few choices: 
send the children with other spawn into the Underdark or back to the Gur. 
Neither was ideal and she knew that. 
Tav: “I suppose this will have to be an olive branch with that lot. Perhaps 
they’ll leave us alone.”
 Astarion: “I highly doubt that.”
 Tav: “I know, but it’s leverage. They still have it out for you, yet they ignore 
they made you, too. If they dare touch you again, I will take their babes and 
kill the rest.”
 Astarion was taken aback. He had told Tav at one point what he remembered 
of his last day living, but she didn’t show the same seething hatred she 
showed now. Her cold stare and coldness in her voice wasn’t customary for 
her. It was frightening that she was willing to reclaim or steal children and 
destroy a clan just to ensure he wouldn’t be followed. 
Karlach: “So the babes are ready to go.”
 Wyll: “We’ll be their escorts out once the sun sets.”
 Tav: “Good. I’ll speak to the woman. You’ll guard the babes. Follow my 
lead. She will have to accept my terms.”
 Both Karlach and Wyll looked at each other a bit concerned and worried. 
This could be a blood bath tonight or later. But, they trusted Tav. She had 
proven her worth before, why not now?
 Later that night. They walked towards the Gur camp, sheperding the spawns. 
They were calmer now having been feed. Tav had paid the others 10 gold 
each to help find enough live animals to feed the poor lot. Even Astarion 
helped, but he took no coin. 
During the walk, only the three of them were present. Tav didn’t want Ulma 
getting any ideas about Astarion. So, it was just Karlach and Wyll. 
Ulma: “I see you decided to come alone, consort.”
 Tav: “Mind your tongue, wench. I’ve got precious cargo. I can take it right 
back.”
 Ulma: “Speak your truth then.”
 Tav: “I propose an exchange. Your children for your cease of hunting my 
mate.”
 Ulma: “Your mate? Pfft That thing deserves to-…” 
Tav: “Spare me your venom, wench. I do as I please with whom I want. If I 
want to fuck a vampire, I will. So, shall you waste more of my time, I will 
take the babes with me. Or you can agree and take your kin back. Make your 
choice, wench.”
 Ulma spit on the floor at Tav’s feet in disgust and anger. Her only peaceful 
protest. She knew Tav wasn’t kidding and finally saw who she was dealing 
with. Tav chose to bed a monster. That made her more dangerous than the 
monster himself. And her claims of taking the children was also true. 
Tav: “Careful now. Cazador is gone, but I’m still here. Make your choice, 
Ulma.”
 She said the name laced with such sweetness that even Karlach’s blood ran 
cold. Tav was not to be crossed when she was in boss mode.
 Ulma: “Very well. Deal. We stop hunting Astarion.”
 Tav: “And you will take care of the babes. If at any point they get too much 
to handle, I will reclaim them. If I get word that they aren’t being taken care 
off, I will reclaim them. Ensure that you and your kin take care of them 
properly. You don’t want to meet me again under a broken pact. Is that 
understood, Ulma?”
 Ulma: “You’d think that we would hurt our own children?”
 Tav: “Is it understood, Ulma?”
 Ulma: “Understood.”
 Tav: “Wyll, Karlach, please. Allow the babes to meet their kin. Children, be 
well. Live, love, and thrive. I’ll be watching.”
 The children walked slowly and uncertain of what would happen to them, but
 they were home. They weren’t sure what to do or how to feel, but they knew 
that at least this one would be their champion in case they needed one. After 
all, she protected the very vampire that had put them there. 
After the meeting, Tav had gone to speak to Astarion about what happened.
 Tav: “I traded the children for your freedom. But if they hurt any of them or 
take up their chase again, they know I will kill them all. I wanted you to 
know from me.”
He was a bit shocked. He’d never known her to be so vindictive, but in a way
 he was glad. The children didn’t have to go to the Underdark and the Gur 
would stop their chase.
 Then just like dreams do, it shifted to something calmer. This time it was the 
tiefling party after they took care of the goblin problem. This memory held a 
special place in Tav’s heart.
 Astarion: “You know, I never picture myself as a hero. Never thought I’d be 
the one they toast for saving so many lives. And now that I’m here… I hate 
it. This is awful.
 Tav: “It’s not that bad. Think of all the goblins you killed.”
 Astarion: “True. That was fun. Still, I would’ve liked more for my trouble 
than a pat on the head and vinegar for wine.”
 Tav took the bottle and tasted it. It was pretty bad, but because Tav didn’t 
like wine in the first place. 
Astarion: “See what I mean? Awful. All I want is a little fun. Is that so much 
to ask?”
 Tav: “And what is your idea of ‘a little fun’?”
 Astarion: “By the hells. Sex, my dear. A night of passion. Let’s wait until 
things quieten down. Once the others are asleep, we’ll find each other.”
 Tav: “All right, let’s do it. I’ll see you later.”
Astarion: “Indeed you will, my love. Indeed you will.
 She then left to go back to the celebration and talk to the people she’d just 
helped. She was enjoying herself quite well. She even consumed some ale. 
Bitter on her tongue, for she disliked the drink, but in the celebration, she 
didn’t mind. But, her body kept taking her back to him. So, she approached 
him another time. Now, a little more tipsy. 
Astarion: “Here’s my little treat with their cheeks all flushed. You will come 
to my bed tonight, won’t you?
 Tav: “ ‘A little treat?’ You can do better than that.”
 Astarion: “Oh, I certainly can, it would be my pleasure. How about this one: 
All these accolades form the Tieflings are nothing compared to the sound of 
my name, cried from your lips.”
 Tav: “So many honeyed words, as usual.”
 Astarion: “Not half as sweet as when I tasted you. Hmm, let me give it 
another go: Every part of your perfect body whispers temptation- it’s as if the
 Gods made you just to ruin me.”
 Tav: “You’re sweet, and sillier than I thought.”
 Astarion: “I can go on all night with the flattery, but is that really what you 
want? How about if I sad these little words… Everone’s favorite… I love 
you.”
 Tav: “Having fun, are you?
 Astarion: “I am, it’s hard not to with you. Now, as much as I relish standing 
around and saying all my favorite lines at you. I’d much rather we got to 
experience each others’ full portfolio of talents once again.”
 Tav: “I’ll come find you after everyone is asleep.”
 Astarion: “I’ll be waiting.”
 Then her mind took her to a little later after she had mingled and danced with
 the rest a bit more, her body took her back to him at his tent. It was as if her 
body couldn’t help itself. 
Astarion: “I hoped you would come. I have missed you. And now you’re all 
mine, and I’m all yours. Until morning at least. Let’s see where the night 
takes us.
 She laughed at this and decided to go back and sit by the fire. Her head was 
spinning a little and needed to calm down. She didn’t know if it was the drink
 or the promise she made him. Meet him tonight when everyone is asleep.
 Tav: “He said he loves me.”
 She smiled at that. She knew it was a lie, but she didn’t care. It was the first 
time anyone had said those words to her. So, what if it was to get her in bed. 
Besides, he was her first mate, so she wanted to hold on to her fantasy a little 
longer. Besides, they were more than willing participants in her little story.  
Finally, her mind took her where she wanted to return. That night at the 
clearing in the forest. 
Astarion: “There you are. I’ve been waiting. Waiting since the moment I set 
eyes on you. Waiting to have you.”
 Tav: “You don’t have me yet.”
 Astarion: “Don’t I? You’re here. And I don’t think you want to talk. I think 
you want to be known. To be tasted.”
 Tav: “And what do you want?”
 Astarion: “What do any of us want? Pleasure. Yours. Mine. Our collective 
ecstasy. That’s what you want, isn’t it? To lose yourself in me?
 Tav: “I want to have fun- that’s it.”
 Astarion: “Then let’s have some fun.” 
He then took her in his arms and began kissing her. She felt how her body 
burned for him. She couldn’t control that feeling or yearning. Even his cold 
touch wouldn’t be able to suffocate her fire.  He lifted her up and took her to 
the nearest tree for support. 
Now it was she who kissed him with the hunger she’d been trying to supress. 
Then she pushed him to the ground to mount him. She was going to claim 
what she felt was rightfully hers. She had chosen him and she wanted him to 
know it. He was now hers. Then he rolled her over and pinned her down. 
She allowed her neck to be free for his lips. He took a bite. The typical cold 
shard was felt until it became a cool numbness that extended all over her 
body. The weight of his body on top of hers was pure ecstasy for her. She 
held on to him to keep him closer as he fed. She trusted him with her life 
even now, like this. 
He  helped her remove her clothing while laying on the soft damp moss of 
the forest floor. Then he marveled at her naked body. Her lustful eyes saw 
him with a hunger, he’d only seen in animals and those like him. She desired 
him, perhaps even more than he dared to admit. Or perhaps there was 
something more. 
Then she beckoned him to claim her. He did as he was told. He began kissing
 her feet, then her calves, went to the knee, and to her thighs. He was taking 
his time with his kisses, learning every inch of her. Little did he know then 
that Tav would do the same to him once he accepted that she loves him fully.
 He felt how her skin was burning, how her blood was flowing due to her 
heart going wild. She was having a hard time controlling herself, but wanted 
him to enjoy this as much as she was already enjoying it. 
Then he continued kissing her hip bones which made her giggle. She was 
ticklish. This could be more fun then expected. He straddled her, keeping her 
knees together and began fondling her breasts. He would pinch her nipples 
lightly and run his cold fingers in circles copying her areolas. He loved how 
her tan skin made them darker. He leaned in to kiss them, to lightly suckle 
them. Her hand went to his head and grabbed a tuff of his hair. Her other arm
 grabbed his shoulder a little too hard. He moand in pleasure. She was being a 
little rougher than anticipated. 
He decided to match her enthusiasm. She took his face and kissed him again, 
this time parting her lips to find his tongue in his mouth. She need to taste 
him lest she go insane. She loved his taste. It reminded her of her favorite 
scent: forest dirt after a strong rain. A moan escaped her throat. He smiled at 
that while still kissing her. 
Then he let go to look at her. She was panting a little but clearly wanted 
more. He lifted her arms above her head and pinned them with his left hand. 
She smiled  at that. Then he kissed her again while his right hand found her 
wetness down below. She gasped. His hand was cold, but her body desired 
him in every each of it.
 Tav: “Astarion, please.”
 Astarion: “Now, now, my pet. Let’s enjoy every minute of this delisious 
torture.”
 He moved his fingers in circles aroudn her little mound and allowed her legs 
to open up for him. He was getting her ready for him. He back arched and she
 cried his name. This would be the first of many. He relished in making her 
cry his name like this. This was all for him. 
Tav: “Astarion, please. I can’t-… Mmm-…”
 She was panting hard.  He leaned in again to kiss her neck, but this time the 
other side. And she took the oportunity she was looking for. She freed her 
hands and placed them right on his back clawing them in to secure them and 
then she whispered in his ear.
 Tav: “Bite me and fuck me hard, Astarion. I’m all yours. Please.”
 That was all it took for his control to waver. He thrusted his hard member 
inside her and he felt her clench and gasp. As he did that, he bit her again on 
the other side of her neck and began to drink. His hips moved in waves and 
hers matched him. Then her legs locked over his hips. She was pulling him 
deeper. 
Both of them were matching the same level of energy. He could feel how her 
body clenched hard, trapping him in her passion. Her nails just dug deeper 
into his own skin. He quickened his pace to reach her climax before he 
drained her dry. And then he felt it. He tasted it in her bloord; pure ectsasy. 
He let go of her neck and kissed her again. She bit his lip drawing a little 
blood. She smiled as she kept kissing him. He began to slow down a little, so 
she took the opportunity to roll him and pin him down. Now it was her turn. 
He let her have her fun. She got on top of him and used her hand to guide 
him back in. He saw the double puncture wounds on the sides of her neck and
 gave a worried look. She saw his face and spoke.
 Tav: “Don’t ruin it. I let you have all of me. Now, it’s my turn, Astarion.”
 She let her whole wait fall on him letting him penetrate as deep as she had 
space for. She felt how he reached to her end. Her skin gave he away, she 
was fire trying to be put out by his cold touch. But, he was causing  the 
opposite effect. Her body rocked back and forth allowing his skin to cause 
some friction on her clitoris. She was having a hard time keeping her moans 
to a minimum, but it was almost impossible. 
Then he reached in and began to play with it using his cold thumb. 
Experienced fingers knew where to touch and how much pressure was 
needed. As she was thrusting, he rubbed in fast circles that began to match 
her own speed. She was almost there. Then he grabbed on to her hips to 
allow her to ride her orgasm without falling off. 
He felt how her legs began to shake and how her arched back just went a 
little further back. She lost it. 
Tav: “Ah-… Astarion!”
He laughed. So much for keeping quiet. He was sure someone must’ve 
woken up by now. But he didn’t care. She was his, at least for now. Then a 
tall broad shadow caught his attention from the corner of his eye. He decided 
to not be bothered. His woman was still riding her second orgasm while 
riding him. This was the bliss he always wanted to have. 
Then she finally got her body to return. She was spent. She bent forward and 
snuggled on his chest, panting but very content. She smiled and drifted to 
sleep. 
Astarion, smiled, too. He felt happy which still was a rarety for him at this 
point, but there was something about her that made it different. Perhaps it 
was that she mated like a wild thing or perhaps it was that he knew she 
wanted him. It didn’t matter. For now, he just let her sleep on top. Once she 
rolled off, he would take her back to her tent. Or maybe just sleep there under
 the stars. Either way, he got his fun and was glad it was with Tav, his Tav.
 Halsin walked away silenty from the forest clearing with a giant smile on his 
face. He was a little dissapointed that he didn’t get a chance to shoot his shot,
 but was glad the little wild thing was finally claiming what was hers. He 
understood her language, for he was a druid. He knew she still didn’t see 
herself as human, so she claimed her mate the only way she knew. He 
thought this was going to be fun to see develop, and he was right. 
Then Tav woke up with a fright. She looked around and felt the cold body 
besided her. She calmed down and found his face.
 Astarion: “What’s wrong my dear? A bad dream?”
 Tav: “Has Halsin seen us have sex?”
 She said with cheeks flushed. She was feeling so embarrased.  He laughed, 
but finally revealed the truth.
 Astarion: “Well, to be honest, all our friends at one point or another have 
either seen us or heard you cry my name.”
 Tav : “No! Gods! That’s so embarrasing! Should I apologize? Should I bring 
it up? Oh, no! This is so terrible.”
 Astarion laughed even harder. It should be the friends who shouldn’t have 
been peeping in the first place. But it couldn’t be helped. She was so deep in 
her passion that it was the only time she was vulnerable. And it was because 
of Astarion that she could let her guard completely down. She felt safe. 
He calmed her down and they stayed snuggled for a while longer. It was 
twilight again and the Tieflings and Druids were moving about, but no one 
had come to the tent to fetch them. They figured they would just relax for a 
little longer before going out.  But Astarion’s curiosity was more about what 
she had dreamed, so she told her the two dreams she had and why she was so 
happy being back here at the Grove. He told her he loved her once more.
