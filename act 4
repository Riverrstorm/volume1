The others got super excited too. It clarified things. 

So, Tav is a wood-elf but in her heritage, there is human blood, too. This created the weird obsession and eventual violence in her people's clan. 

I haven't written this information yet, but the Storm clan was started by an ancestor who was a slave for the Drow in the Underdark. Eventually gained his freedom. So, the full context is still simmering.

Tav happens to be a ranger class. She's a hunter, especifically a Gloom Stalker. She has been trained from an early age to live of the land. Consider the information of Native Americans before the Europan virus invasion. 

So, everything that she does or consumes, is thanked, it is respected. Regarding the necrotic energy, that's DnD lore. When Astarion feeds on an animal, the flesh cannot be consumed. So, she does her rituals to try to salvage parts of the animal. The rest are buried to cycle back into the land.

About Selune, it will be seen more towards the end, like clarifications about it. But Tav at this point has a close connnection to the moon, not Selune. The reason, Tav didn't go to school. The wilds raised her from 13 years old. Her companions were the stars and the moon at night when the forest was the most dangerous. 

The fire spell was Gale's doing. He didn't think it would cause any harm to teach Tav level 1 or leve 2 file spells. But Igne Furia was an emotional response towards a very bad man who hurt the love of her life. Magic flows all around them, but Tav is untamed. Her fury when focused can be devastating to the agressors.

Regarding the mythological framework, it was accidental in a way. I didn't plan it. I simply had to read up on it to "polish" it a bit. 

First: In game in Act 1, there is a quest to save the Grove. This means to attack the goblin camp. The goblin camp IS Selune's Temple. It's supposed to be like a 10 minute walk from Emeral Grove where the Druids and the Tiefling Refugees are. 

In the game, this is the first time you can enter the Underdark, if you haven't used the giant hole that requires a feather-falling spell. 

So, since I didn't know about the entrances to the Underdark in Baldur's Gate City, I led them on a journey to the Grove. Later I found the information about the entrances to the Underdark, and just adjusted the story to give the journey purpose. 

Still, Tav will not know about Selune. To be honest, she will know about Selune in chapter 19 or chapter 20. 

But Selune will keep presenting herself at every moment possible. Astarion has begun to notice this 'showing up' of the divine, but because he doesn't believe in divines, he makes no mention to Tav. Besides, she wouldn't get it anyway. She's not a cleric, a paladin, nor was she raised in a city. She feels the pull to Selune's untamed raw energy, not the cleaned up 'scholarly' version of man.

The timing from Baldur's Gate to the first city is like 2 weeks, maybe... I forgot the exact time. But we used a DnD map that gave approximate distances covered. The gang did the math and I then balanced out the details. The four gave me similar data, so just ironed out the kinks. In total, the journey to the grove will be 1 month.

The mirror connects to game and DnD vampire lore. Astarion doesn't have a reflection. So, it anchors the story to its trope: dark romance fantasy. 

The only "opposing" diety is Shar. Not in a direct way. The Selune Outpost, where they want to get to, is directly in the Underdark, Shar's domain. 

Shar is also 'owner' of everything bad, including vampires. Tav's love for Astarion directly opposes everything Shar stands for. Tav knows little about Shar from her time with Shadowheart before Shadowheart stopped being a follower of Shar. So again, Tav goes on vibes and what's "right".

Regarding the writing process, I don't know. *shrugs.*  It's hard to explain, but when I'm in the "zone" I see flashes of scenes, like I'm watching a movie and I transcribe it. Then, I ask the gang questions about things to ensure they are 'canon aligned' to the universe of Faerun. Everything else just sort of 'appears'. 

I've made little to no notes and most are technical like a metal bucket can carry 13 lt of water or the measurement of the log and wood type. 

About Tav's story, same thing. It sort of 'popped up' and I wrote it down. Since she is the 'player character', she's got no story. So, I suppose the muse thought it acceptable to give her that story to ensure Tav's survival with a vampire clan in the Underdark.

So about Astarion's body... yes and... this is also Selune's doing. She is dipping her thin fingers in their lives like a puppet master, and her charge, the narrator is allowing us to see what's going on. *winks*

Wait until you find out who the narrator is?! It's not me. I am not inserting myself, I'm just the medium that types it up. 

The Narrator is a character that you, the reader, knows about. That's why sometimes, they talk to you. But the people in the story know nothing because they're just living their life. We are the vouyeurs who are peeping in. 

And so about the creative process... burst of energy. Mostly that. It's a lot. I mean, I have to watch a lot of video content of the video game and read articles about areas in game and quests. Then the gang helps me with extracting the data form DnD lore books to ensure I am not 'manipulating' the story, but rather telling it like it is. 

I haven't written the voices of other characters like Shadowheart or Lae'Zel because I haven't seen sufficient content to 'know them'. It's in the back burner for sure.
