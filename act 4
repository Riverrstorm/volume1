Chapter 9
 At Twilight
 A loud grumbling, gurgling sound awakens them. Astarion looks at Tav with a surprised look, and Tav 
gives him an embarresed smile. She begins to sit up to get out of bed. Astarion follows.
 “I seem to be a little hungry.”, she said trying to stiffle a laugh. Her body feeling lighter, but her 
stomach demaning attention. 
“You don’t say. I thought there was a bear right beside me.”, he laughed while heading out the tent, 
looking back at her.
 She got her pack and got some things out to prepare herself a meal. A small pan, a water skin, a bottle 
of wine, what she had left of her bread, cheese, and dried meat. Perhaps tonight was the last time she’d 
have this and the next meal she’d have to hunt for. It was fine, though. She wanted to collect some pelts
 for sale or trade if they came up to a new town. 
She thought that the best way to get easy supplies was to work for them. She was also pushing Astarion
 to not steal things just because he could. They both could, but she was more comfortable if they took 
from obvious, long forgotten ruins and not form Jacob, the shopkeeper, or something like that. 
Of course Astarion, was a little annoyed by that, so he kept his hands to himself, for the most part. 
“How much of that food have you got left? Is it still good?
 “Well, the bread is a little stale, but it’ll do in a pinch. I’ll just toast it with the cheese and it’s pretty 
good, still.”
 She said this as she was putting her iron skillet on the rocks from the fire. She placed the pre-cut slices 
of bread on the skillet to let them toast a bit.
 “Besides, I had pre-cut slices to allow it to dry. It’s a little trick I learned. If it dries faster, it won’t 
spoil. I also place some drops of water on the hot skillet and cover it up. The vapor helps soften it a bit 
as it toasts. The cheese will also help a little as it melts. Then with the dried meat, I will add more water
 to soften it, too. I’m basically making me a sammich with extra work. But it’s good, I swear!”
She explained this like if it was such a normal thing to do when you went on a long excursion towards 
danger.
 He looked at her intently as she was fussing over her meal preparation.
 “You know, I never really noticed you the living have a lot of things to consider to simply stay alive. 
Here I was focusing on my own things, but you also have to consider even the little things.”
 “Well, yeah. I think we both have little things and big things to consider. That and also, I live my 
creature comforts. Just because I am living in the woods, doesn’t mean I want to also live like an 
animal. And neither should you, to be honest.”
 He agreed with a nod as he thought back on the little things she had tried and kept or forgotten about. It
 was almost military in her part the way she organized and prioritized tasks to either ensure hygene or 
cover up the tracks of a feeding vampire-spawn.
 I wonder if it bothers her to have to do all those things. I mean, even I get annoyed 
at times that I need to help out with the hole digging, but I certainly appreciate her 
reasons. She doesn’t want ayn Gur on our tracks.
 Tav was a ranger and had learned a lot of things to keep herself safe and unseen in the woods or most 
any other place with enough shadow. In part, this was a reason why she didn’t miss the sun and 
daylight much. All her life, she’s lived in shadows, though she is a day-walker. But she wanted to keep 
him safe as well as have a comfortable stay at their temporary camps. Though, it was a little tiring for 
they stayed in camp about 12 hours give or take a couple hours more or less. 
When a new campsite was scouted out, she tried to go for spaces near water. She prefered ponds or 
lakes, for Astarion, but rivers and streams for her. Either way, water was important. She had fashioned 
water skins from the stomachs of some bears Astarion had fed on which allowed her to carry a bit more
 for things like washing up and cleaning. She knew about the necrotic energy left behind animals he fed 
on, so she didn’t consider using the meat for eating. She would just keep the pelts rolled up after she 
was done with them. 
When pelts where involved, they would stay a day longer to allow then to dry properly, with a little 
help of elemental magic, of course. She saw this as currency whenever possible. She’d collect 
medicinal herbs and forests fruits, too. Anything that could be carried for then to be sold and traded. 
She had gotten better at finding and keeping food stuffs and medicinal stuffs in good condition long 
enough to be traded for needed items. 
She’d gotten soap, bread, dried meat, and good cooking utensils, so far. Her next goal was to get a 
small cart that she could push with their gear on top. Astarion thought it was unecessary, but secretly, 
he did like the idea of not having to carry his pack. 
But for the most part, it was the little things that fascinated him. She was alive, so that meant eating and
 then then, well. . .  so, her way of managing that was interesting to him. He never paid attention to the 
crew before because there were so many, but now it was just her. 
She called it her “poop tent”. 
“Poop tent? Seriously?,” he asked, with a surprised yet disgusted look on his face.
 “Well, that’s what it’s for. What else would I call it? The tent of secrets? Now, that is stupid. Besides, 
it’s bad enough your hearing is so good that you can hear when I pass wind. Like this we can both be 
uncomfortable.”, she laughed as she kept digging a deep enough hole. 
He helped her dig her little trenches here and there. But, her logic seemed pretty solid. The tent was a 
little restroom, where you can have a private moment like wash up or for poop and pee for her. All 
water and waste would collect down the path that was dug down into a deeper hole. Said hole would be
 covered with branches and leaves to allow the air to pass and minimize gas build up from the waste. 
As for Astarion’s food, that was kept in an area a little further away from the main tent. She would tie 
the legs of the animals and raised them to make them look like they were being bled. Her benefit here 
was she was a ranger, so if anyone came looking, she’d have no issue explaining she was just hunting 
for food and sale. But in reality it was just a front. Those animals were no good after he fed.
 Right as the packed up their camp, she and Astarion would place the carcases with the lingering 
necrotic energy in the waste hole and then she would use a fire spell to burn it all. Then she would 
place dirt on top of it, add a sappling or seed, water it, and be on her merry way. 
He found this to be very much a thing she would do, even without him and his kills. 
“Hey, are you okay? You seem lost? Come back to me, my Star.”, she said softly as they kept walking 
in the dark path with only the moonlight to guide them.
 “Huh? Oh, I’m fine. I was just thinking back on all the little things you do. I mean, from trying to cover
 my tracks to your little tent. And you just keep taking things down and putting things up, with a smile. 
It’s fascinating.”, he mused while looking at her with a raised eyebrow.
 She blushed. She had thought, he hadn’t really noticed the little things, but she was wrong.
“Well, my poop-tent is my best idea so far. But thank you for noticing. I don’t want any freaking Gur 
getting ideas. I swear, I see one or a couple, it’s on sight! Two chops to the throat!”
 She punched the air as if she were fighting with some imaginary man in front of her. His expression 
softened. His little killer was still not forgiving the Gurs for having attacked him over 200 years ago. 
That made him think of something he rarely did. 
Just how dangerous was this woman? It made him shudder to think about the details, but despite her 
size, she had somehow managed to do things out of character for someone that short and young.
 She was 40 now, for any elf, she’s just a child, but she also carries human blood, so that means she’s in 
her prime. She lived alone most of her life and she lived in military training practically since she was a 
babe. Then she befrended the most unlikely bunch of folks and they made her their temporary defacto
leader. She tried to pass on that claim to anyone else, but the group didn’t budge. From the Blade of 
Frontiers, to an explosive mage, to an even ill-tempered Githyanki, she managed to win them over. 
Then out of all things good and holy, she took a liking to a vampire-spawn. So much so, that she 
offered herself to keep both the spawn feed and the rest of the crew relaxed about the spawn’s feeding 
habits. They didn’t like it much, but she explained to them what she would do and how she would do it.
 Listen, it’s fine. Really. He will feed in private, so you guys don’t feel 
uncomfortable and neither does he. I still got some of my berries. I just eat 
them after a feed to recuperate faster. I’ll be fine. Besides, he needs to learn 
how to control his hunger and feeding habits. If he kills me, he will die, too. I 
doubt any of you lot would be as relaxed about him as I am. So, I am safe. 
Adding to the fact that he also feeds on large beasts that I manage to track. I 
simply top him off. It’s fine.
 The group wasn’t too happy about this arrangement, but she was stubborn enough to make it happen. 
Besides, she was safe. She trusted Astarion with her life, even back then for when he had the chance to 
kill her, he didn’t. And if he failed to stop feeding in time, Karlach would burn him up, Wyll would 
behead him, and the rest of the group would also have their fun. 
“According to the map, we will be arriving at a little town in a couple of hours. Would you 
like to see if there’s an inn?”, he asked.
“Yes, I think we should try and see if we can get a room. So, anyway, how are you? How are 
you feeling?”, she asked as she looked out to the horizon.
 “I. . . I feel better. I think better than I have in a long time. Thank you. And you?”
 “Same. I mean, I feel better, too. I was carrying those emotions and ideas for such a long time 
that I hadn’t realized just how heavy they became. Thank you for. . . holding me as I feel to 
pieces.”
 “Thank you for holding me, too. Now, let me go gag for being so sickly sweet.”, he fake
gaged.
 “HAHAHAHA! Let’s do something manly to regain our manliness then!”
 He laughed with her as they kept walking. He liked her company especially when she would 
match his dark humor. They could be as caring and sweet to each other when the time 
needed it, but at the same time they enjoyed seeing two trolls trying to fuck in a barn while 
laughing at the sight.
 “Oh, look! I can see the tops of the buildings. I think I should go in the inn first if they have 
one and try to get a room. You go and brood your way into a corner for now and then we’ll 
meet up in the room. Well, if it pans out that way. Otherwise, we’ll head into that  abandoned
 building on the west side of the town for now. Let’s hurry. It’s almost sunrise.”
 They quickened their pace and Astarion took a right leaving her while she kept going to a 
building that looked like an inn. 
It was. She checked on the door. It was open. She took a deep breath and stepped in. 
“Hello? I’m sorry to disturb at such an hour, but I am looking for shelter? Hello? Anyone?”
 A creak was heard and someone shuffled inside a room. Then a door opened and a man in his
 sleeping tunic appeared, disoriented but trying to find the reason for being awoken.
 “What in the good heavens? Who are you? What do you want?”
“Oh, dear! I’m so sorry! I thought this was an inn. I checked the door and it was unlocked!”
 “What? Oh, yes, yes. It is. It’s just that this hour is not conventional for any patron”
 “I know and I’m sorry, but I have been walking for hours and this is the first town I’ve seen. 
I’m just so tired and I got excited when I saw this amazing place out in the darkness.”
 “Mmm, well, we have some rooms available. How long?”
 “A day. Well, the thing is that I need a room for my partner as well. Would that be an issue?”
 “Might, but not for me. Rooms have a single bed. You can either share or rent two rooms. 
What’ll be?
 “One room is fine. Do I pay now or later?”
 “You pay now to have the key to the room. Top floor, at the end of the hall on the left. We 
offer food and drink after 9am if you are interested. Rooms have a water basin for washing 
up, but for toilet use and showering, there is a cabin for that outside behind this building. No 
extra charge for that.”
 “Oh, that’s fantastic. How much do I owe you?”
 “That’ll be 3 gold.”
 She handed the money, thankful that it was certainly cheaper than Baldur’s Gate. She headed 
up the room to check it out, but as she passed by the inn’s door, she opened it and whistled. 
Astarion heard it and got out of his hiding place to go in the inn. 
As he stepped in, tall and pale, the inn-keeper gave a little jump. He wasn’t sure why, but 
that man had something about him, though he was still too sleepy to find out. Astarion 
simply kept looking at the stairs as he walked toward them. He quickly went up and caught 
up with Tav as she opened the door.
 It wasn’t much, but it was clean and it was safe from the sun. By now it was starting to 
become day. Astarion stayed at the door as she dealt with the window. She marked on the 
ground with a coal she kept, just how much direct reach the sunlight entered through it. This 
was more for her to calm her nerves.
The room would do in a pinch. It had a single bad on the furthest corner and a small table 
with a chair across. There was a chest at the foot of the bed and right in the middle of the 
furthest wall opposite the entrance was a small window. This one was a 2-pane with a 
vertical slider and shutters on the inside. 
After Tav marked an outline of where the light touched the floor, she opened the glass 
window pane and closed the shutters. Then took a leather strap and fixed it to keep it from 
opening on accident. Then she took a cloth and placed it on top. Was it excessive? Yes. But 
she was very thorough when it came to Astarion’s safety form sunlight. Even a sinch on his 
skin was unacceptable, especially if it were by her own lack of preparation.
 Then she beckoned him to enter fully into the room. He gave her a thankful smile for her 
efforts and took off his pack and gear. He closed the door and walked over to the chair. She 
gave him a look.
 “What’s wrong, love?”
 “I wanted to use the chair to block the door? I don’t want any other stranger opening it by 
mistake while we’re in here.”, with a worried look on her face.
 “Hahaha! I almost forgot about that. But, we sure looked divine. How about we just move the
 table instead?”
 “Mmm. . . let me see. . . Oh, I know. I’ll tie some straps to the door-lock and I think I can get it
 to the bed.”
 “Don’t, give me ideas, my dear.”, he said with a seductive smile.
 She blushed and felt a little jolt of energy from her stomach down her body. He was certainly 
right about this, though. He could simply wisper numbers in her ear and that’d be enough to 
send her flying.
 “Oh, you! Stop it. You only get like that when you’re hungry. You haven’t eaten well in a 
couple of days. So, move it over and let me set up.”
He laughed to himself for it was true. He found that when it was getting closer to feeding on 
her, his body started to desire her in all the ways it should be desired. So, he took off 
everything else he had on except his briefs. Perhaps he could get lucky after “eating”, or at 
least not be so hot in this stuffy room.
 Meanwhile, Tav also took off her gear and clothes. She only kept her shoes on and her 
undergarments like Astarion. They surely behaved like an old couple by now that they’ve 
spent so much time together. She occasionaly looke over and saw him looking at her, and 
she’d still blush after all this time. 
Get it together woman! He’s seen you better than you can see yourself 
with a mirror and tasted every part of you, yet you still blush as he sees 
you in your panties and bra? Seriously.
 She then took out a water-skin and a small wash cloth. She wasn’t in the mood to go outside 
and freshen up. Then she saw the corner where the inn-keeper said the water and basin 
would be and decided to use up her water and take new fresher one. 
She walked over and poured her water in the basin and placed her wash cloth in, got it wet, 
wringed it and then began cleaning her neck. She knew Astarion wouldn’t mind feeding on 
her as she was covered in sweat and dirt, but she wouldn’t have it. She was gifting him her 
life, and she wanted it to be clean.
 He enjoyed looking at her while she washed up. The way she would pass the washcloth on her neck 
with some force to really scrub her skin. The way her skin would protest and turn red, and the way you 
could tell how her skin looked a deep copper for her skin was darker, as expected from a wood elf. Her 
skin was not as dark as the druid Halsin, but not as light as his. He always thought that perhaps high 
elves always had a light skin color and now that he was a spawn-vampire, perhaps it went lighter. 
Either way, he found her fascinating.
She then continued with her face and arms. Rub and rub, wash, wring, rub and rub, repeat until done. 
The only thing that she didn’t do was between her legs as she preferred a proper bath or shower for 
that.
 Then she saw that there was  a metal bucket under the basin and poured her dirty water in it. She’d 
throw it away later.
 Then she turned to Astarion.
 “You’re next. Come on.”, she said as she procured a new wash cloth from the pack and placed hers on 
the back of the chair. She poured the last of her old water in the basin and stepped aside.  
He stood up a bit reluctantly. He preferred to keep her scent lingering on his skin, but she would be 
upset if he didn’t clean up a little. At one point she told him there wasn’t any reason to be unclean just 
because he was undead. That’s what Shadowheart meant, though. Tav did have “mom” vibes at times 
and was rather pushy when she wanted to. 
So, he took her wash cloth from the back of the chair and threw the clean and dry one at her while he 
gave her his mischievous giggle. If he was going to be forced to clean himself up, he’d do it his way. 
She just rolled her eyes and laughed. 
She too enjoyed watching him as he cleaned up. She wondered how she got so lucky with finding a 
man like him. He was gorgeous in her eyes and despite being undead, a bit arrogant, and conceded, she 
felt that it was just a front. He was caring, and he was soft. He was strong and resilient, too. He was 
very clever and had a dark sense of humor just like hers. To her, it wasn’t just his body which she found
 attractive, it was also him as a person. His handsome face was just a lucky bonus, but she’d figure she 
would have fallen for him even if he were fat, short, and hairy, or missing something. In other words, 
his physical beauty wasn’t the only pull he had, it was his essence.  
As she was lost in her thoughts about him, he started with his face and hair. Then his neck and 
shoulders. He also rubbed the cloth hard, but his skin remained the same shade or marble white. 
Occasionally, he’d turn to see his Tav watching him with flushed cheeks. He knew she was a bit hot 
and bothered, but she’d never admit it. Though she was always a more than willing participant, it still 
made her blush.  
As he finished, he rinsed out the wash cloth and placed it back on the back of chair, poured his water in
 the bucket , and walked towards the bed.
 He looked at her with with seductive stare. That one he knew would get her going and spoke.
“My dear, shall we? Get comfortable”
 Suddenly, she felt her head spin as her heart rate spiked. Even after doing this countless times, she 
couldn’t helped but get a little aroused at the expectation of his bite. Perhaps she would never admit it 
out loud, but she found these kinds of moments with him very erotic. She had heard stories from time 
to time when a little younger when she visited some towns. There was at one point that she landed and 
Baldur’s Gate, though she didn’t know it was. But she heard the most stories there, of balls and halls, 
and people being seduced. 
By now, she guessed the stories to be true and that many of them were about the beautiful man walking
 towards her. The only difference now is that he wasn’t being forced to seduce anyone. He found her to 
be the most beautiful being in existence and wanted her for who she was and not what she offered. That
 was her bonus. 
As he placed a knee on the bed, she gasped. He laughed a little.
 That’s right, my love. I love how you still react like that when I am 
near...ly on top of you.
 He couldn’t help himself when his giveaway laugh escaped his lips as he continued crawling on the 
bed. 
“Oh, no… what are you planning, you! Stop it!”
 “What? little o’ me? I’m just getting comfortable to. . . eat. What ever shall you mean?”
 She gave him a suspicious look. She knew him enough to know him better. He was going to turn on his
 charm to the max. She stood no chance. To the world outside, he was wrapped around her finger, but 
here, like this she was his and he knew it.
 “Fuck.”, she let it escape her lips knowing his intentions.
 “Gladly.”, he answered back. 
He placed his knees firmly on the matress and grabbed her hips, with his strong arms he turned her 
facing down. He’d never had her like this and was dying to try her this way, at least for a while. He 
prefered to see her face as he pleasured her. 
Now, facing down, her breathing accelerated. That feat of strength really got her going. Though he was 
strong, he was always gentle with her. He tried things only if she was all right with them. This time, she
 had no complaints, so he continued. He caressed her back with his index finger. It was cold to the 
touch, but quickly warming up, because of her. She was on fire, for him. He smiled and continued. He 
placed his hands on her hips again and lifted her buttocks up towards his hips. She reacted with a moan.
 This time she would be able to cover her mouth lest she lose her balance and plant her face on the 
mattress. He know that, too. 
“I thought you were hungry?”, she said in but a whisper.
 “I am.”, he replied with that simle that melted her resolve. 
She couldn’t see his face, but she knew that smile and that voice. He was extremely famished, and so 
was she.
 “Are you hungry my beloved?”
 She gasped and with a shaky voice she managed to say, “y. . .yes. Mmm. Yes, please.”
 He grabbed her from her hips again and thrusted his own hips towards her. He was teasing her now, 
enjoying how her body gave little shakes and her breath accelerated, all in anticipation for him. He 
loved this, he loved her. He loved how she wrapped herself around him, but it was too soon for that. He
 wanted to make her exhausted not the other way around.
 “Astarion, please.”
 “Sh. Now, now, my love. Great things come to those who wait.”
 As he said that, he grabbed her from her chest and pulled her upward. He nestled her body on his torso 
and her neck right where his face was. He was showing her how easy it was to dominate his little 
assasin. A moan escaped her lips as she closed her eyes. The pleasure she felt having this man, this 
monster, be able to have her this way was such extasy for her. She loved this, loved him and wanted to 
be consumed by him, by his touch. She wanted it all as long as it was with him. 
He began to hum his melody from before as he gently swayed from side to side with her body firmly 
held on his arms. Then he began to have fun. His left hand frimly held her from under her arm, across 
her breasts, and his left hand stopped close to her collarbone. But with his right hand he began to caress
 her left cheek, then he trailed the tips of his fingers down her neck, and down to her breasts. 
He started massaging her right breast, then playing with the nipple to make it hard. Then he squeezed it
 lightly, and as he squeezed, he began sucking on her neck and her ear lobe. 
“Mmm”
 He continued by kissing her neck with his cold touch. He found how his skin warmed slowly with the 
more he pleasured her. He felt alive when they were like this, her body like putty by his touch and his 
skin warm again. This was the best place to be.
 He played with both her breasts and nipples for a bit knowing full on well that the longer he waited, the
 more moist she’d be for him. But, he had to check just in case, didn’t he?
 He moved his hand slowly down her stomach and she gave a little jolt. She knew what he was doing 
and was about to melt into him. As he slid his hand down, first he went on top of her panties. He 
touched her through the cloth and she shuddered lightly. He smiled and began to nibble at the skin of 
her neck. She buckled as he touched her and nibbled on her neck at the same time. She dind’t know 
what to do with her hands, so she threw them backwards to grab at his own briefs, pulling him closer.
 She got him, too. A moan escaped his lips, too. She smiled.
 “Right back at ya, love”, she whispered.
 “Oh, it’s a competition, now? Good to know. I won’t let you win.”, he purred in her ear and then licked 
her neck with his cold touch. She gasped. She was gone. 
“Mm. .  . Astarion!”
 As she moaned his name, he covered her mouth to stifle her moan.
 “Hush now my love. We don’t want to wake up the others, now do we?”
 She bit her lip as he removed his hand fom her mouth while she moved her head from side to side in 
response. But by now, he was right with her. It was time to do what he desired. He wanted to claim her 
again, but now it was different. Before they were broken. Now they were whole and recunstrected from
 pieces of each other. Today, they would finalize their claim on each other and finish what they started 
back at the base of the cliff. Today, they would release the last remanents of the past imposed and 
started anew on their own terms.
 He slid his fingers down her waist to catch the cloth of her panties. He didn’t want to rip them, he just 
wanted to slide them down to make it easier. So, down they went as a little growl escaped from his 
throat and a gasp from hers. She had waited long enough. 
He braced one knee to hold his their weight and used the other to move her leg. Then with his right 
hand he helped her move her right leg out of at least one pantie hole. Now, she was free, and so was he.
 He pulled down his briefs to reveal his already hard member just waiting impatiently for his master to 
do what both wanted, to lay claim to the woman in his grasp. Astarion readjusted her leg to spread it a 
little more. Then he slid his right hand again down her stomach and then a little further down. He found
 what he wanted. 
“Ah. . . Mmm”
 “That’s right my love, don’t you ever forget you are mine, lover.”
 “Mmm. . . yes. I. . . am. . . yours.”, she panted.
 He began to use his hingers to lightly press her clitoris while using a circular motion. He loved how she
 lightly moaned whenver he touched her that way. She found his hand and guided him in the direction 
that caused her more pleasure. This he love the most. Even now when he was doing his best work to 
make her know he’s got her, she still manages to let him know that she’s still in control. He loved this 
woman in ways he still didn’t understand, but she was his, and he was hers. Now, forever, always. 
Then he used his hand to guide himself inside her. It was time. As he slid in, finding it tight as always, 
so he had to fight his way in, he arched himself back just a little. As he did this, she curved to the side, 
leaving her neck exposed. He couldn’t say no to this invitation. 
He took a bite as he entered her tightness. Then he begun to lightly thrust. She couldn’t help herself and
 clawed her fingers into the back of his thighs. As they did this, a supernova exploded inside their 
intertwined souls. 
He fed on her, feeling how her life flowed into him. He felt how tightly she received him, choking him.
 She felt how his teeth pierced her skin and her blood rushed out. How his cool lips formed a tight seal 
on her hot sking and throbbing neck to not let any drop escape his lips. He felt how her heart pounded 
fast on her chest and her breathing was deep. How her nails pressed hard on his own skin as the 
pleasure of all of this happening all at once was sending her over. 
This time, she didn’t shout his name, she whispered it with such love, such passion that now it was him
 who couldn’t handle it. He began thrusting faster and faster, until his love flowed into her and she 
accepted him deep inside her.
 Both panting, they weren’t done. He stopped feeding on her, but kept slowly thrusting inside her. Now, 
he just kissed her neck and lighthly nibbled on her ear. But as he kept going in and out of her tightness, 
he pushed her down. This took ger by surprise and she began pushing back. It would always be a battle 
with this two.
 As he pushed forward, she pushed back. They met half way. This was probably how a volcano felt 
when it was ready to destroy a town. He grabbed her waist to have more control on her rhythm as he 
began to pick up the pace. She was about to let go. She bit her forearm to stiffle a scream, but he caught
 her. 
“No, my love. That’s mine.”
 He grabbed her arms and pulled her up, she had no choice. His name escaped her lips as she moaned.
 “Ah. . . Ah. . .  As. . . tarion!”
 “My love! Yes! Mmm. . . Aah!” 
As they came together, he let her go. She fell forward and as she did, he followed, landing on top of 
her. 
They laughed as they lost their balance once the exploded together. As he was on top of her, he kissed 
her shoulders and rolled off her. 
It was a small bed, so he had to maneuver himself to not fall as she moved over to lay beside him. They
 embraced each other while looking at each other. Her eyes showing that this was the last thing she 
would do for a while. He smiled at her and kissed her forehead.
 With a wisper, he told her as her eyelids were closing, “Rest now, love of mine. I’ll take care of you.”
 He held her as she fell asleep while a broad smile appeared on this face. He was happy. This woman, 
was surely something else.

 A couple hours passed and now the sun was at it’s brightest, you could tell because the window let a 
little light in around the curtain Tav had placed. She began to wake, opened her eyes and looked up. 
She smiled at him and he smiled back.
 “Hey. Did you know that I love you?”
 “Yes. I do. Did you know I love you?”
 “Yes, very much.”, she shifted to hug him and then kissed him on the cheek. 
Then she grabbed hold of her panties and put it back on properly by sliding her leg back in through the 
panties hole. Then she rolled on top of him to get up, but he caught her. He hugged her with a light but 
firm grasp.
 “Now, where do  you think you’re going, my love?”
 “I. . . well. . . I’m getting dressed and going downstairs.”
 “May I ask what for, my love?”
 “Uh, well. . . No reason now it seems.”, she answered back as she laughed. 
As she allowed her body’s weight settle on top of  him, she asked him, “So, then what’s the plan then, 
Astarion?”
 “Mm, good question. Are you  hungry my dear?”
 “Well, now that you mention it, I think I am. Can you please go with me downstairs?”
 He rolled his eyes pretending to protest at her request, but she knew that he had a hard time denying 
her. He didn’t like having her being alone in places that were new with other people potentially trying 
something funny. But in all reality, people were more in danger of her if they crossed her.
 He let her go, so she could stand up. She did and walked over her gear, and as she did, Astarion 
observed her movements. She wasn’t graceful and dainty. If he had to compare, he’d say she had the 
same grace as an orc too big for its size. She was powerful, every movement calculated and rough. She 
wasn’t raised to be a dainty flower. No, she was raised to be the force of a thousand oceans clashing 
their waters together to take down any powerful fleet. That was his Tav. A force of nature all bundled 
into 1.5 meters of magic turned flesh and that was amazing to him. 
Pants on, top on. Chest plate on, bracers, boots, belt, all of it on. Then her cerrated knife, hidden on her 
left boot. Her dagger, his gift, on her right leg. Then her trowing spikes hidden on her left  bracer. 
Another dagger hidden on the right bracer, a dagger that he also gifted her. The only things she wasn’t 
going to equip were her swords and bow. If he hadn’t known she was a ranger, he’d swear she was a 
rogue like him.
 Then she sat on the chair and took her chance at looking at him while he got dressed. He loved his 
theatrics and love to give a show. He brushed his fingers through his curls and gave her a wink. His 
broad shoulders and chest stretched as he flexed his arms up made him look like Atlas. He then slid on 
his leather pants. She quite loved how those in particular accented the toned muscles on his legs and 
buttocks. She was a butt-girlie, what can we say. He buttoned up his pants and then got his doublet. He 
tended to prefer this one with the embroidered design in gold with purple stained leather. It was 
mended but it fith his figure in all the right places. She was certain if she offered to get him a new one, 
he might say no for he has his favorite. This made him so human and common, a typical guy with a 
favorite shirt who wore it so much it will eventually fall apart. If and when that day came, she would 
make him something else with it or try to fix it for sure. He certainly loved to look and feel extravagant.
He put on his embroidered leather boots, who he actually enhanced. She loved the fact that he was so 
good with his hands in more ways than one, in particular regarding his clothes. He always looked so 
handsome, even when he didn’t in her opinion. Then he too began to hide his own weapons pretty 
much in the same places as Tav, for it was him who taught her how to keep her danger hidden. Then 
they were ready to go downstairs.  
Chapter 10
 What’s for lunch?
 She walked down first and he followed. As they took every step down, with deliberation the 
people chatting and laughing took notice. They perhaps could feel it deep inside that what 
was walking down the stairs was danger in the flesh. The woman, bronze goddess with gear 
that meant she was no dainty, frail woman. Behind her a much taller man, pale and muscular 
with red eyes and a look of arrogance, quite the difference from the woman for despite her 
wild look still carried a friendly smile and eyes. 
What a pair and what a sight. As she reached the floor, she looked towards the bar where the 
inn-keeper was cleaning some ale mugs. She headed towards him as Astarion took a turn and
 headed towards the furthest table on a corner that was partially covered in darkness. In truth,
 it was also very far from the door leading outside and that particular corner didn’t have 
windows. It was the best place for him to see the people there while also not give an 
accidental show of flames. As he sat down at the table, broody, mysterious, and quiet with a 
face that could kill, he looked towards the direction of Tav. She was about to try out her 
charm. She was hopeful for a trade or a sale. 
They weren’t running low in funds as of now, but she had taken the effort to cleanse and 
clean them, she might as well try. From what he recalled she had put some work into these 
pelts and were ready to be used. She always took great care into making sure things would be
 useful and safe, even for him.
 He remembered when she stayed up until late some days ago to clean the pelts collected. He 
had fed on the bear and since then a couple of foxes, a wolf, and a stag. In her view, it was 
unfortunate the meat  couldn’t be harvested, but the pelts could with a little help. She asked 
him to put the carcasses on the respective holes and set them on fire. That would at least 
cleanse the necrotic energy left behind from his feed and allow nature to recuperate nutrients 
in the ground for future life. He found that poetic. He was the reason for death, but she 
helped him bring life again.
 As for the pelts, she’d do the dirty work herself. First stretch the skins tight and proper. Then 
with the knife, remove all the fat from the skin and collect that. The fat would be boiled and 
clarified as much as possible. From this fat, she made candles for our use. This meant she 
didn’t have to cleanse that. Less energy spent here. As for the skins, she would use fire to 
help the drying prosses accelerate. Then, brush the hairs to remove any mud or blood stuck 
on it and allow the natural oils to move back into the hair. Then add her own special mix of 
oil that would help the cleansing of necrotic energy. 
He thought it was curious how she always waited until the moon could offer enough light, 
but at times she would clean them during daylight. Either way, she would do this barefoot. 
She would really dig her feet in the dirt when she applied the oil and brushed the hair of the 
pelt. She would whisper into it. She allowed the energy of Faerun enter her and use her body 
to transmute the energy of lingering death into her, to be cleansed and come out renewed for 
life. 
From life comes death. From death comes life. The blood we take, we take no 
burden. The life we take, we give back life. Let this sacrifised life know it was not
 wasted. The flesh gives back to the nature it came from. The blood gives life to he
 who was robbed from it. The skin will give warmth to those that accept it. No part
 was wasted. No part will rot. Enter in me that which life rejects and let me birth 
it back into the energy of the universe. I will it by the fire that burns in me. I 
will it by the blood that runs through me. In perfect love and perfect trust. So 
mote it be. This is so, and it is done. 
It took him by surprise how the energy shifted from that general location. He was a little 
saddened that he had left that kind of mark, but then here she came and took it into herself 
and transformed it. He was thankful, but there was surely a seed of doubt planted. Was this 
the type of energy he left in her when he fed on her? She offered herself wilingly everytime. 
And he certainly accepted her offer, for more reasons than just one. But, was she carrying his 
energy the same way the pelts were?
 Back in the inn, she was chatting and laughing with the inn-keeper and some additonal folks 
he hadn’t noticed while he was daydreaming. He could hear parts of their conversation quite 
clearly for she tended to speak loud enough for hm to hear whenever he was “moody-sitting”
 on a corner. 
“Thank you so much for the room. It’s perfect. I slept very well.”
 The inn-keeper blushed as she said this. She hadn’t realized his own room was right under 
hers, so he kind of, sort of, hear them making love right before she fell asleep. 
<<cough>> “Certainly, Miss. I’m glad I was of help.”, he still said while trying not to choke in
 surprise.
 He hadn’t seen Astarion well, but seeing that marble-statue of a man walk down the stairs 
with her and she was now standing here like it was no big deal, certainly caused him a bit of 
a shock. Astarion noticed and laughed to himself. He still enjoyed the reaction he caused 
strangers, but even more so if they somehow heard how he made love to his woman, to then 
have that same woman walk out of the room like it was nothing more than a walk in the park.
 Astarion figured that either Tav didn’t notice the reaction people had or she didn’t care 
enough to notice, either way, she will turn heads. 
“So, I wanted to ask some things if you don’t mind. You see, I am a ranger and a merchant. 
My husband and I travel from town to town selling our goods. So my first question is, do you
 know of a place here in town where I could possibly sell somethings? Or even trade for others
I don’t have? The thing is that this is the first time we’ve been to this town. We usually 
traveled further north, but I was feeling a bit daring and I convinced my husband to go 
south.”, she said this with a bright smile, despite some lies.
 It was true she wanted to sell or trade, but she was no merchant and “my husband?!” That lie 
right there surely would ruffle some feathers on a pale-elf.
 HER HUSBAND?! I AM HER HUSBAND! WHAT? SHE SEES ME 
AS HER HUSBAND ALREADY?! What am I doing?! I haven’t 
even. . . I mean, should I? Does she want to be. . . my wife? But, I 
am. . . a vampire. . . not even a full one?! Hells! Is this what I want? 
I mean, were practically married now, living and travelling 
together, but. . . would she want it to make it official? Does she 
want that? She deserves the world and more. Can I be that one that 
gives her that? I do want to make her mine. . . I thought I had made
 her mine. . . I mean. . . every time I make love to her, aren’t I? 
What?. . . I. . . do want her to be mine, to make it official. Yes. I will 
find a way to get her a ring and ask her hand in marriage. Tav, I 
will make you my wife. You are already mine. It will just make it 
official. 
The determination on his face was almost frightening. There she was oblivious to
 the lie she said just figuring it would make it useful. Some of these towns didn’t 
take kindly to young women staying in rooms at inns with men, especially if the 
noice they made was heard. She certainly wasn’t saying it to cause any reaction 
on anyone, espeically Astarion, it was just a clever ploy to get sympathy points 
from strangers to earn quick coin or trade. 
Some folks from the tables nearest the bar stood up and walked over interested 
in the conversation. It wasn’t everyday they met women that looked like 
assassins strike up a conversation with such a friendly demeanor. She was 
interesting, to say the least. 
“I’m sorry for eavesdropping, young lady, but did you just say you’re selling items?”
 “Oh, hello, sir. Yes, you see, my husband and I travel the woods together and we explore and 
I find things that can be useful for others, but hard to get. For example, medicinal herbs, some
 dried goods and even pelts.”
 An older woman joined in looking at Tav with interest and some distrust.
 “If you don’t mind me asking, dear, but why are you and your husband traveling the woods 
together? You look so young, should you be bearing him children? Can he even provide a 
home for you?”
 It took all the energy in his soul for Astarion not to leap and tear this woman apart. How dare
 she  question his Tav? How dare she imply that he cannot provide for his woman?!
 Does this woman want a death sentence?! How dare she even…?! What 
do you mean I can’t provide for Tav?!. . . Can I?
 As he was losing control again of his emotions and thoughts, Tav took the conversation and 
flipped it. She wasn’t about to let some strange old lady make her feel bad about her life 
choices. She’ll learn today to mind her poison. 
“Well, miss. I don’t see why you are so daring in coming to a stranger and try to make them 
remember things that are painful and out of their control, but I’ll humor you.”, Tav said with 
tears building in her eyes and a shaky voice. She was really digging in ther theatrics.
 YOU DARE OUT POISON ME, SNAKE! LET’S JUST SEE WHO IS 
BETTER. YOU WILL LEARN TODAY THE DIFFERENCE 
BETWEEN VENEMOUS AND POISONOUS, WENCH!
She continued with a sad face, “you see. I was born baren. I cannot give my husband any 
children, try as I may. We’ve been traveling all over for four years now going to mages and 
clerics, and everything in between and nothing. I was born broken. I will never have the joy 
of being a mother. Are you a mother? Could you imagine your husband wishing with all his 
soul to start a family, fall in love with you and then you cannot provide? I’ve carried my 
sorrow and my husband carries me. He should be off with another that can offer him children
 but he chose to follow me. So that’s the reason, which you don’t deserve to know, but I am 
not ashamed. It was not my choice that my body cannot give life. But it is my husband’s 
choice to stay with me despite it. So, are interested on some healing balm, pelts, or just want 
to make me feel miserable for not being woman enough?”
 The way the other town’s folk saw the woman turn beet red and storm off was priceless. It 
was obvious that said woman did this sort of thing often, but was rearely if ever put in her 
place. As for Tav, she was thankful for the woman, for her sympathy points overflowed. She 
was certain that she’d sell all, trade all and achieve her objective, she wanted her push-cart.
 Astarion couldn’t believe just how insane these last couple of minutes had been. Hell, the last 
couple of hours, from making love to his woman, to becoming her husband in front of 
strangers, to being call unfit as a man, and now his Tav is baren and he chooses to stay with 
her. 
Obviously there is a mix of truth and lies in everything Tav is saying, but she isn’t saying it to
 cause Astarion any pain or discomfort. She wasn’t to cause it to that nosy woman that was 
too smug for her own good. Too bad our favorite vampire-spawn can’t read Tav’s mind to 
calm his.
 Is she. . . baren? Does she want children? Does she want mine? But, I 
can’t have any. . . Curse you Cazador!. . . But, who am I kidding? Had I 
not been turned, then I would have never met her. But, still. I never felt 
that I wanted children, and a stable home, but Tav. . . Does she? With 
me? I need some fresh ai and I can’t leave. Oh! Gods! I can’t. . .
 Meanwhile, Tav was having the time of her life, enjoying the attention and working her 
charm to get her little cart. She was oblivious to the fact that her lover was losing his 
mind in a dark corner listening in to her invented banter.  Furthermore, she couldn’t wait 
until they left town to tell re-tell him her thought process, because she found these 
interactions hilarous. 
“So, how about it? Any particular place I need to go to?”, Tav continued.
 “Well, miss. I think this is a good a  place as any.”
 The inn-keeper with a booming voice got the attention of the patrons present. 
“Folks, gather around. Today is your lucky day. We’ve got some goods that might be of 
your interest for coin or trade. This here miss, has something for you, your misses, or 
anyone else that might need something they didn’t know they did.”
 “Hello, respectful town’s people. My name’s Tav and today my husband and I came to 
your home looking for sale or trade of some goods. It would be my pleasure to show you 
my wares, if you have coin.”
 She proceded to open up her rucksack and put things on the bar. Some dried goods and 
medicinal herbs a long with ointments made from clean fat and herbs wich were infused 
with magic. 
Then she said loudly, “Astarion, my love. Could you get the pelts from the pack in the 
room, please? I forgot to bring them down. Thank you.”
 He snapped out of his whirlwind thoughts, stood up, and headed upstairs. The town’s folk
 turned to see him stand up, walk over, walk up, and disappear in seconds. There was a lot
of dried gulps when they saw him, for his beauty was other worldly but his demeanor 
made him look like he was the embodiment of “if looks could kill”.
 It wasn’t long before he came downstairs with his hands full. He carried about 6 or 7 
pelts, one of them the giant bear. He walked towards her, placed them on the nearest table
 to her, kissed the top of her head, and walked back to the corner to possibly brood or 
sulk. Whatever makes him happy, for sure.
 Tav displayed her items rather proudly. She took joy in making them and was certain they
 would be useful or even make folks share her joy in using them.
 “How much for this?”
 “Well, that depends, do you want a trade or use coin?”
 “What do you take in trade?”
 “Right now, the medicinal things, I’ll trade for food or soap.”
 “Soap? Surely, you can make it? You made all this, I suppose.”
 “Yes, but soap that smells nice takes longer and I don’t have that kind of time or 
equipment. So, do we have a trade?”
 “Let me go to my home and get some soap. Can you hold on to these two jars of 
ointment? My mother likes these ingredients for her worn hands.”
 “Of course, let me put these to the side.”
 And off went her first potential customer, a rather young man with freckles and red hair. 
Then the inn-keeper began,” A bear?! Could this be used as a rug?”
 “A rug, a pelt, a dress, a cape, or just for décor. Who am I to judge your good 
judgment?”, Tav laghed.
 He saw the size of the woman in front of him and the thougth of haggling went out the 
window. If she took down such prey, he dind’t want to think of what she’d do to a 
haggler. Or what her husband would do either. That one looked more like an assassin 
than her. 
“200 gold? Do you think that’s a fair price?”
 Tav gave a dry gulp. She was charming, but she was horrible putting price on things. 200 
was a lot for her, but she had learend to not go lower. 
“Um… 200 gold. . .”
 “Okay, 300 gold, I can go no higher.”
 “The bear goes to this fine young man at 300 gold.”
 He blushed at the mention of “young man” for he was clearly not even close to 30 
anymore. 
And like this they traded and bought with coin the things she wanted to sale. She thank 
them and blessed them on their way with a smile. 
Then she looked at back at the inn-keeper and asked him what she wanted the most. 
“So, sorry to bother you again, but do you know of any carpenter in these parts? I’m 
looking into buying a little push-cart, so we don’t have to carry so much on our backs.”
 “What kind are you looking for, miss?”
 “I suppose 4-wheels, that I can push myself. I am not looking to get an animal for it. But 
large enough for my packs, a tent and my merchandice.”
 “Well, if you don’t mind, but I might have something of interest out back.”
 Her face lit up. Though Astarion wasn’t too happy. He could go with her to check it. But 
he had to accept that she was just as dangerous as he was, so he just stayed put. 
As Tav walked out, she squinted her eyes. She certainly didn’t miss the daylight and 
surely at this hour. Perhaps it was around 1pm or 3pm, either way it was too bright and 
hot and her eyes hurt. 
“Over here, miss. This is it.”
“It’s not much and she sure has been used, but I’m not using it. To be honest, it was my 
wife’s, but she has recently changed hobbies and doesn’t care for it anymore.”, he said 
with a booming laugh. 
Tav inspected it, taking in consideration if she could fix it in case it broke down. It was 
basically a bunch of branches held together with wishful thinking. She fell in love at first 
sight. She knew Astarion would have it and was kind fo glad he couldn‘t be here with her
 as she handed over the gold for it. She laughed. It was a done deal. 
They both walk inside all smiles and laughter. Astarion saw them, saw her. She too had that 
mischievous laughter herself. But he couldn’t reach the door at this time. He’d have to wait a little 
longer. He was getting even more worried. Especially since stayed at the bar.
 “Pardon, but you mentioned before you offer food? Is that option still available?
 “Yes, miss. Here is the menu. What would you like to order?”
 “Let me see-… I will start with-…”
 So, she order her several dishes and drinks along with food for the road. She usually went with her 
classics, bread, dried meat, and cheese and one or two bottles of wine. She was not a fan of it, but 
Astarion liked to drink it from time to time, so she didn’t mind it. But this time, because she was 
celebrating her little push-cart, she asked for four bottles of wine.
Then she headed back to Astarion’s table and sat down. She was quite merry for things went pretty well
 for her. Astarion wasn’t sure how to start the convesation. He felt nervous and unsure how to start. 
Should he aske her about the husband part or the part she was baren? Was she being honest? So, he just
 smiled and watched her in silence. She was hungry, so wasn’t paying too much attention to his 
broodiness. Besides, he usually was a little sour when he had to be surround by people. She focused her
 attantion on the waitress that was to bring her food. Tav was getting impatien, but happy when it came 
to her food. She enjoyed her little creature comforts a little too much at times. 
Her first plate arrived, she put her hands together, bowed her head, gave thanks by blessing those 
whose hands prepared the meal, those who worked the land to obtain the food, and the food itself for 
being willing to be part of her essesnce. She even blessed the fact that it would become part of 
Astarion. Her devotion to him was everywhere and that made him even more anxious. 
Blessed be the hands that worked the land to grow and tend to the plants 
and animals for this meal. Blessed be the hands that worked their magic to
 make this meal. Blessed be this meal that will provide me the energry to 
share my life essesnce with the one. And blessed be the one who will 
accept thy life source to cleanse his essence with this light. So mote it be.
 Sometimes it felt a little too much for him. Perhaps he gave his answer too quickly back at the inn at 
Baldur’s, but he felt so sure back then. And now, was he having second thoughts?
 Now, she’s eating like nothing happened and I’m here. Should I bring it up? Does she want to marry 
me? Kids? If I needed to breathe, I’d be having issues with that right about now. Gods! I don’t want to 
lose her, but what if there is someone better out there and I’m here wasting her time? She deserves it all
 and I’m here taking it. What if-…
 His thoughts were interrupted by a little foot finding his knee under the table. It was Tav. She was 
happily eating her meal with a smile while her legs were outstretched and it seemed she had removed 
her boots to touch him. Once again, here he was taking her attention. 
“Tav?”, he asked with a worried face that he couldn’t hide.
She finally noticed. She saw his face of worry and she sat up straight. Then gulped down what was in 
her mouth. 
“What’s wrong my love? Talk to me. You’re making me worry. What happened?”
 She quickly stood up and went to his side and hugged him while he remained sitting. She held him 
there while caressing his scalp. 
“What’s wrong Astarion? What happened? Talk to me, baby? What’s going on?”
 He didn’t know what to say. Everything was just stuck in his chest and his throat. And her reaction 
wasn’t what he expected. Why couldn’t she  be colder towards him? Why didn’t she just answer coldly 
and with disdain? Why did she ran over to hold him in a loving embrace? What had he done to deserve 
it?
 She took her hands and held his face and pulled him to look at her. She had to see him, see through him
 to find out what was happening with him. She saw his sadness and it confused her and scared her. What
 did she do? Was it something she said? But she didn’t say anyting, did she? She’d been pulling things 
out of her ass to sell and it worked. Whast it that? What the hell did she before? She couldn’t 
remember. 
My love! What’s wrong?! I don’t like those eyes when they are sad. Why 
can’t I rememer what I said before? Is it the food? Is it the noise? Does he 
want to go now? Did someone contact us via the stone? But I have it as a 
necklace. So, it can’t be that. Dammit Astarion, talk to me!
 “I will wait for you in the room upstairs.”, he managed to whisper. Then stood up and left.
 She was worried. She asked the inn-keeper if he had a little container or anything to put her remaining 
food away. It was likely they were ready to head out soon. The man oblidged and gave her partchment 
paper and a small wooden tray. She packed her food, and did a little incantation to keep the food for 
sometime. Though she was worried, she wasn’t about to waste it. You never waste food. You never 
deny food or water to those who ask. And you are thankful for what you get. At least, that’s what she 
had learned in her solitude during her younger years. 
She headed upstairs with her little try of uneaten food, reached the door, and openened it. She saw 
Astarion was sitting on the bed with his head down. He looked defeated and she had no idea how we 
got to this point. 
She placed her tray on the table and turned to stand in front of him. He grabbed her waist and hugged 
her. She hugged his neck and head, too. She was unsure what was going on, but her heart felt heavy. 
This wasn’t hers, though. It was his. 
“Talk to me Astarion. Please my love. What ever is the matter?”
 “I don’t-… I-…”
 He looked up at her, unable to find the words to express his frustration, and fear about her. He had felt 
so useless and undeserving of her earlier, it was driving him mad. All his emotions about her and about 
things around her were bubbling up and he felt weak. 
“My love, perhaps breathe? Copy my breathing. I might help? I cannot let you go outside, yet. It is still 
too bright out, so you’ll just have to make do with what we can.”
 He squeezed her tighter. He was trying his hardest to not cry, but he was losing. 
“Astarion, you can pretend nothing is wrong, but I know you are lying. I can’t read your mind, but I 
swear I’ll figure it out if that’s what it takes.”
 He pressed his face to her stomach and she could feel the wetness on her shirt. She knew what was 
happening just barely, but she didn’t know what to do. Then he finally spoke. 
“Why-… me?”
 “Why you what?”
 “Why are you with me? Why didn’t you marry someone who could give you children? Why would you
 choose a vampire time and time again? Why-…? 
He finally wept. 
“This again? Astarion, what am I going to do with you, beloved? Just because. Because, I’m stubborn. 
What does it matter? I’m here. You’re stuck with me.”
 He kept looking at her with the same sad eyes. Then it dawn on her, she finally remembered the earlier 
interactions and some of the things she said were the culprits for this now. 
“Oh, fuck me-… I didn’t mean-… I mean-…” 
She sighed. She motioned him to let her go so she could sit on the chair.
 “Did my lies get you hot and bothered, Astarion? That’s what they were. And they worked. Don’t take 
them personally-…  I mean, what’s really the problem? I know you enough to know that my words 
were just a catalyst to something that’s really eating at you. I can’t help unless you let me in, my love. 
Let me in.”
 A tear rolled down her cheek as she looked at him with saddened eyes. 
Gods dammit, Astarion! Get it together! Just tell her! But, why is it so 
difficult?
 “Tav. It’s just that-… When you were talking with those people, you-…”
 “Did you doubt my words? Is it because I called you my husband? Astarion, out of all things holly, my 
love! Look, I know it’s not something we’ve discussed. And I honestly don’t mind. I mean, I never 
expected you to want to marry or anything like that. And what we have seems to be working, so why 
rock the boat? You know. Besides, I raise less suspicion as a woman travelling with a freaking divine 
god made flesh. That and why do you keep questioning my choices? I find it hurtful that you keep 
judging me for choosing you. No, I don’t see you as the sorry sack of shit you think you are and I will 
never see you that way. I chose you because I wanted to choose you. I want to be with you and I am 
selfish for my choice. I want you and you alone. And I don’t care if you don’t understand my reasons as
 to why you. You are not supposed to understand my why. I only beg you to let me love you without 
questioning my reasons every fucken day! I chose to love you out of my own free will. I will the nature
that surrounds me and I will my heart to let me chose and if that means to choose an undead then for all
 that is holly and unholly, I will always choose you, Astarion. Why can’t you just accept that? Accept 
me? Am I so wrong? Am I so unworthy of you that you need to question my resolve everyday?
 “Tav, it’s just that-…” 
“No, Astarion, it’s just that fucken nothing! I know missery loves company, but for fuck’s sake! Why 
are you so intent in staying his?! I can’t fight the dead when you refuse to accept that you are doing all 
in your power to stay his! I can’t fight him. He’s dead, he’s gone! But unless you accept that, he’s still 
controlling you, I can’t fight him. In to the fire I swallowed his hate, but my love unless you let me in, I
 can’t win and neither can you.”
 What?! But-… this is about-… my god! She’s right. 
“Astarion, for over 200 hundred years, you were broken, maimed, abused. I know that you don’t know 
what love is. I know that you don’t understand what that means. But I beg you to do something if not 
for you, then please do it for me. At least try, please. I need you to pay attention around you. I need you
 to focus. I need you to learn about love.”
 “What? Learn about love? But how?”
 “Love is an energy that is all around us. Sometimes you can love and other times you can be in love. 
They are not the same. To be in love feels like a fire. It’s a pull that you feel for another. Like your 
broken pieces were broken in order to let the other enter and stay. They won’t heal your broken, the 
broken parts will always be there, but your beloved fits right in, inside those spaces that would have 
been empty without them. Like you want to possess them or consume them and you and they feel the 
same. Like you were born broken in half and like this, you can get back together and become the one 
you were supposed to me. That’s what you feel like to me. I can’t explain it other than my love is 
selfish. I want you. I need you. I choose you every morning and every night. It’s always you. For many 
reasons and for no reason at all. I just do. And I can’t explain why I am in love with you for I don’t 
know myself. You aren’t easy to love, Astarion. You are a broken man that is just barely learning how 
to be yourself. That’s why I asked you to really think about it back at Baldur’s Gate. I told you to take 
your time before you gave me an answer. Now, my need for you has grown so much, I don’t know if I 
will be able to go back to just being friends. I don’t want to just be your friend. I want to be that and 
more. But I need you to start your journey to understand love. Love doesn’t mean you find someone 
you pefer to fuck. No, love is simple. Love is kind. Doing little things and big things can be acts of 
love. Kissing on the cheek, giving a blessing, buying something just because you want to, that can be 
love. I need you to pay attention and learn from those around us. Learn how to love, Astarion. Please. 
Learn from me. Learn from others, but learn. Please, perhaps like this you can one day let me love you 
the way that I can.”
 “Tav-… But I don’t-… But-.. It’s just that I can’t give you children! I can’t even offer you a stable 
home?! I have nothing to offer you. Nothing! And I hate that! I have no money, just a pack of clothes 
and a bag with some gold. That’s not even enough to buy you a house to keep you safe! What kind of 
man wishes to mary a woman that’s magic and then has her sleeping on the ground?! I have nothing to 
give you. I just take and take and you keep giving like it’s nothing. I-… I hate that. You deserve the 
world and more, and I-… I’m just here-… being a burden to you. You fixed the tent so in case of 
emergencies, I remain safe, you burn the carcases to avoid detection of the Gur hunters, you sell the 
pelts, you even use yourself as a vessel to cleanse my necrotic rot! Why are you so good to me? I’m not
 easy to love, and yet from nowhere you came and stayed. You trusted me even when my intention was 
to use you. And, I don’t know what to do? Then we are heading to a dangerous place because you want 
to give my kind the same chance you gave me! Woman, have you got any ounce of self preservation?”
 It wasn’t everything that was eating at him, but that was a start. 
“First of all, children? You’ve never even mentioned that. Is that why you’ve been-… coming inside 
me?! Astarion, you can’t do that! Not like that. We’re going on a difficult mission. I can’t be worried 
about having kids. Don’t get me wrong. I have no idea if I even can. My fat-… that man, he fed me 
things when I was 13. I don’t know if they wrecked havoc. I don’t know if I can even carry, but believe 
me that if I could, I want you to be the father.”
 He looked at her with surprise.
 She doesn’t know. Perhaps we’re both baren. Oh, gods! How cruel can 
this life be? 
“Secondly, neither do I, you idiot! I have no land to claim. I was banished and even if I hadn’t been, I’d
 still have nothing to my name. We’re the same. What we’ve got here is all that we can give. I got about 
1000 gold now and that’s just today. You’ve got a little more than me. Thirdly, a house? Seriously? I’m 
basically a fucken bog witch! I’ve lived alone in the woods. I’m nothing more than a whisper to idiot 
hunters in the woods. If anything, I have more possessions now and our tent which to me is our home 
with you than I every did”
 He gave her a half smile. 
“And fourthly the reason I do all the extra work is because I’ve always done it for myself! I’m a ranger 
but I also had to live in the dangers of the forests alone as a woman! I cannot leave a trace of anything 
lest I am found by men. A lot of men together can be dangerous to any woman, especially if this said 
woman lives in the woods without a clan. My act of love toward myself simply expanded to include 
you. That’s my love language. I do things because my love is selfish! I get joy from lightening your 
burden. I get joy from seeing you happy and smiling. I get joy from knowing that I did something to 
help you. I do it because I love you and because I love myself. That’s why I need you to learn about 
love.”
 He stood up and walked towards her. He wanted to hug her, but she swatted his hand.
 “No! No hug for you. I’m really mad at you right now. But, you will not be free of me. Now I will stay 
with you if only to spite you. You want to wallow in your fucken misery like you did for him, fine. Be 
miserable, but know this Astarion, I will not go. You can’t get rid of me just because you are caught in 
your feelings of misery. I will be miserable right along with you, so move over Mr. Miserable because 
your fake wife, Mrs. Miserable, will out do you in your self-serving pity party.”, she said as she pointed
 her index finger at him. 
He had never seen her this angry, but he deserved it. He made up scenarios in his head because of 
Cazador’s shadow. He made sure Astarion and the others know they were nothing and they believed 
him. And now this woman was a willing participant to give him all that Cazador told he would never 
have nor deserve.
 Astarion went back to sit on the side of the bed, looking at the floor. He felt he made a mess of things 
and now she was mad at him. Perhaps, it would not last long. 
“And one more thing, Mr! We are taking a shower once the sun goes down before we leave. I bought 
my little cart, you will push it or pull it when I get tired! That’ll teach you for interrupting my meal! 
Gods! When do I interrupt with your food-… idiot”
 He couldn’t help but laugh. She was in a worse sourn mood because she was still hungry. He had feed 
on her right when they arrived at the inn and he got in his sour state right about when she was about to 
start eating. She’d probably even have a heachache.
 “Tav, do you have a headache?”
 “Tav, do you have a potato for a husband? What do you think?!”, she said in annoyance.
 He laughed lightly then stood up and walked towards her. He then placed his hands on her temples. The
 coolness of his skin worked wonders whenever she had a headache. He stayed there as she ate. While 
he was like this he remembered when she suggested to modify the tents to make one sun-safe or sun
proof. 
“Hey, so if we’re not going to be using my tent anymore, let’s work some magic.”
 “What ever do you mean, dear?”
 “So, yesterday we kinda, sorta saw the path we’re taking to reach the grove. And I saw that if we try to 
keep to the forests and trees, we’ll take longer. I get anxious just thinking that we’re taking longer to 
get to the babes.”
 “The babes? You meant the spawns? Seriously, woman, but I’ll humor you. What have you got in 
mind?”
 “Well, I was thinking, I’ve got my extra pelts, and my tent and my idea is to combine yours and mine to
 make it very sturdy. My tent can be the the inside layer, then in the middle I can use the pelts to make 
them leather, finally the outside layer. That’s three.”
 “Why the leather?”
 “That’s where the magic lies. You will help with that. You will help embroidering some-… a lot of 
glyphs that will create the protective barrier.”
 “What kind of glyphs? I am not a magic “doer”. So, how do you intend on achieve this? Gale isn’t even
 here?”
 “Look, I love Gale to bits and pieces, but I can do some stuff, too. It will work. I’ve done it, but at a 
smaller scale.”
“I’m not so sure about this, but fine. It’s not like we have a lot of work anyway.”
 So, they detoured and stayed in the Wood of Sharp Teeth in order to get materials and shade as they 
worked on their special tent. First, Astarion needed to draw some warding glyphs  on the outer canvas 
layer and then with a knife he scratched the same on the leather layer. Then he added Selune’s Crescent
 on several areas of both the outer layer and middle layer along with runes of warding. On the inside 
layer he drew the symbol of the Moonmaiden. All of this from a book with clippings and parchment 
from other sources. It was as if Tav would take bits and pieces of things every time she went to a town. 
When she handed him her book of “notes”, he gave her a look. She explained that she didn’t steal the 
things, she simply stayed long enough to copy things that were interesting or that seemed important. 
Then he noticed she had no boots on. She was covered in mud and grass stains and even had some 
twigs and tree pollen in her hair. She was a sight, but he let her work. 
She moved back and forth gathering a pile of items. She had bee’s wax and fat in a little pot. She had 
procured some thick branches wich would be the stakes and some thinner twigs and twine along with 
some vynes. She had a knife and was already buidling a fire.
 As they both worked, they would occasionaly look at each other and smile. They mostly spoke when 
Astarion needed more thread to continue his part. She had quite a bit, but considered that he should 
start with the leather layer first in case they had to switch to grass fibers to finish. The canvas would 
have been easier to work the grass fibers in in case needed.
 All in all, they made copies of symbols and then Tav went to his work and added some from nowhere 
but herself. She was very concentrated on these ones. Then she simply said “it felt right to add that one 
there” or “I think that can help.” Either way, they were added to each of the layers. They worked hard 
on all parts. Even the stakes were engraved and marked with holding wards. 
Astarion had not noticed it at first, but then he realised that what he was hearing wasn’t the wind in the 
trees, it was her. She had been whispering incantations left and right as she carved, drew, and burned. 
She sometimes would put her hands over something and whisper several things. 
Even when she was water proofing the outer layer with wax, she drew on the sygils with wax first and 
then painted them over with the rest of the wax. Everything smelled like the forest after the rain. 
Once they finished with their work, she was spent and so was he. She ate some forest berries and went 
to sleep. He decided to get some small game for the time being. 
It took them 2 full days to finish it, but then they had to test it out. The following morning she set out to
 put up the tent outside the forest. The sun was not out yet, so Astarion helped, but she rushed him. She 
was more nervous than he was. She had the canvas Gale had enchanted before he left Baldur’s Gate 
that was intended for emergencies. So, they stepped inside, but she didn’t let go of her emergency 
blanket in case Astarion got burnt by accident. 
They waited inside. It was cool to be inthere. She wanted to make sure it was fine, so she pinned the 
“emergency blanket” to the entrance flap of the tent and wiggled her way just enough to get outside. 
And she shouted.
 “It’s sun out! You’re safe! It worked!”
 He laughed so hard inside that he dropped to the floor. This mad woman had succeeded in making it 
safe for him. That would surely quicken their pace if they didn’t have to keep to the woods. 
Now, back in the room at the inn, he came back to the present. Tav was still eating her meal, but now 
she was wiggling a little. She tended to do that when she enjoyed her food and drink. 
“Tav?”
 “No, shush it. I’m eating.”
 “I’m sorry.”
 “No, shus it. Not ready to not be mad. Shush it. Let me pretend to be mad a little longer. Like that 
you’ll knock it the fuck off, young man.”
 “I’m over 200 years old.”
 “No, you were taken at 39. You’ve just stuck around. I’m a year older and that counts. Shush it, young 
man.”
He laughed and started to walk back to the bed.
 “Nope. Get back to your spot. You wanted to feel miserable, then let’s. Touch my head. Go ahead. 
Touch, touch. When I finish my meal, you’re free.”
 She proceded to take her sweet time finishing the last piece she had. He didn’t mind. He was glad they 
were in a better mood now. But she was right about him, he had been choosing to be miserable despite 
her efforts and he felt wrong for that. 
He wanted to find a ring without her knowing, but that would be challenging. Perhaps they could find 
some ruins or something for him to stay away from the sunlight but still hide his surprise. 
“Okay, I’m finished. I’m taking a nap.”
 “Sleep well, my love. I promise I will pay more attention.”
 “Shush it or you’ll scare of my naps”
 Either way, she leaned in to kiss him on the lips and crawled over to the other side of the bed. As soon 
as her head hit the pillow, she was out cold. 
Astarion stood up, took his coin purse from his pack and the rest of his “safety geart” which he had to 
rummage through his pack to recover. His friends had gifted these items to protect him from the sun. 
He was grateful for this. Then he stepped out of the room.
