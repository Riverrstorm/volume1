Chapter 17- When we get home...
 Halsin took the time they rested to have a little chat with Okta about the 
proposition that has just been presented. Okta was surely interested in the 
woman and her vampire lover. The last time she had met them, she 
remembered they did have an odd energy to them. Knowing now that they 
are mated, she understood that it was them pretending to not like each other.  
But she was still curious.
 Okta: “So, what’s the deal with you and those two? Are they mated?”
 Halsin: “Hahahaha. Indeed, they are. And good thing, too. They just made me
 with the bet.”
 Okta: “A bet? Halsin, what are you on about? Is this the reason you took 
longer to return?”
 Okta was getting irritated with Halsin answers, but she didn’t know the half 
of it.
 Halsin: “Oh, don’t get angry, my dear Okta. You see, when they rescued me 
from the camp, I noticed they gave each other quick side glances all the time. 
And they always gravitated towards each other. So, when I agreed to help 
them for a while, I paid more attention.”
 Okta just looked at him a bit distrustful of where this was going. 
Halsin: “So, I wasn’t the only one who took notice. It was camp, it is small, 
and the wind carries voices. She was always very giving to everyone, even to 
me, but with him, she was extra caring. I remember when she told of 
Minthara, the drow, for making a joke about Astarion. The only reason Tav 
let it go was because Astarion defused the Tav-bomb.”
 Okta: “Interesting. So, she’s very possessive of the vampire? That’s not 
something you hear every day.”
 Halsin: “I think that she sees him as a man, not a monster. Which would 
explain a lot of what she does. Perhaps she just thinks he’s sick. But I digress.
 The more time I spent with the group, we all took notice of their behavior. 
During searches, they would end up together. Most her loot, would go to him.
 She said she didn’t need it, and he sure didn’t mind having it. Even he would 
go out of his way to accommodate to her. They developed this relationship 
where they practically shadowed each other while working hard to hide it 
from the group. Hahahaha.”
 Okta: “I’m guessing they fooled no one. That bad, was it?”
 Halsin: “Worse. They were so lost for each other while trying to keep the 
“we’re just friends” idea that when he, per her request, asked for sex, she’d 
agree all the time. We all knew they tried to sneak at night, but like I said, it’s
 a small camp.”
 Okta: “That’s horrible. I mean, for them having no privacy, but I guess you’re
 right. The wind does carry.”
 Halsin: “I know. The worse thing was that at one point or another, we all 
either heard them in her tent while feeding him or somewhere they tried to 
hide. I know Astarion did notice, but she was too far gone at the time to 
notice or care.”
 Halsin blushed a nice shade of crimson as he recalled walking in on them 
here at the Grove. He, too, remembered that Tav kept going back to Astarion 
as he brooded over by his tent. She kept going back and forth, drinking a 
little too much, so her movements became very obvious for the rest. 
They got to talking about the Astarion-Tav “situation-ship” and they were 
enough annoyed and a little jealous that they began to plot. All of them, even 
Lae’Zel, were going to push this along to make them accept that they are 
basically married. Karlach was thrilled with the idea and made a bet with 
Gale and Halsin that she could push the love birds into admitting they were a 
couple. Gale accepted, but he said that he was better with words, so it would 
be him. Halsin added that he felt he had the best chance. 
Shadowheart tried not to get involved because she thought it was wrong to 
interfere, but they were all enough drunk that she ended up falling in the plan.
 Lae’Zel offered to pay closer attention to their whereabouts to see what they 
were up to. Wyll, though embarrassed, would try to talk to Tav and see her 
standing about Astarion. 
They knew Astarion tended to leave the group while at camp, so they weren’t
 worried he’d hear the stupid drunken plan they were creating to play cupid. 
As for Tav, she came back all tipsy with a giant smile on her face for the 
second time. 
Tav: “I’m having fun tonight. More ale! Let’s all have fun.”
 They looked at her flushed cheeks and giant smile. They knew what she 
meant and burst out laughing. But Shadowheart, took her mug and instead 
filled up a wine bottle with water. She gave it to Tav. Lae’Zel offered some 
bread. They needed her to eat and drink to help with the alcohol. Tav was the 
only one who rarely drank, so very little went a long way very fast.
 As they continued with the celebration and Tav’s back and forth walks, they 
felt joy. It was nice to be at peace and with friends. It was also nice to see 
how two friends were beginning to develop a little romance. 
As they went off to rest, one by one, Tav finally was more able to think 
straight. She downed a loaf and a bottle of water. She waited until everyone 
was in their own tents to finally go look for Astarion. It didn’t take long for 
her to find him, though. 
Halsin on the other hand, had decided to go for a walk and also patrol the 
perimeter of the grove. By the time he reached the area where Astarion and 
Tav were making love, he tried to walk away without making noise, but he 
caught Astaion’s eyes right before he closed them again as he enjoyed his 
Tav.
Okta brought him back from that night.
 Okta: “So, I’m guessing your meddling worked?”
 Halsin: “Well, to be honest. It was not needed. Tav claimed him from the 
very start. For her, it was just a waiting game. I think she was certain that she 
would convince him to trust her enough for him to accept his feelings for her. 
And it worked. I simply suggested to Astarion to take the long way to the 
Grove. This would give them time to get to know each other without us there.
 A bit of freedom to love in private.”
 Okta: “That’s understandable. So, you really trust them with all of this?”
 Halsin: “That I do. Astarion has begun to learn who he is with her help. As 
for Tav, she can be ruthless when she needs to be, but she does have a heart 
of gold. She meant it, all of it. She has no home and is desperately looking 
for one for the both of them. That and she loves your group. She doesn’t offer
 to gain an advantage. She offered because she loves your people enough to 
fight for them again.”
 Okta: “Yeah, I got that feeling, too. She’s very serious about it. I mean, that’s 
a lot of gold. And I get the feeling that even if we decide to continue our trek 
to Baldur’s Gate, she’d probably escort there and run back.”
 Halsin: “I agree. She’d split herself up if she could. I think that she has some 
logic in her mad plan, though. We’ve never thought of rebuilding this place 
nor of taking back the forest. Perhaps she’s thinking of rallying forces to 
remove the threats or create a treaty.”
Okta: “But we’re not that many. It would be slaughter. We barely make it as it
 is.”
 Halsin: “Understandable. But, perhaps that’s where her plan begins. Not on 
the Tieflings, but the spawn. She said her next place is the Underdark. Maybe
 those are the forces?”
 Okta: “Well, I guess we just have to wait for them for more details before we 
make a decision. But, I’m not going to lie, I kind of do like the idea of 
making the Grove a worthy town for us.”
 Halsin: “I agree to that, too. Now, please excuse me. I’m going to go and 
check on them, see if we’ll talk tonight or later.”
 Halsin left off, heading down to the gate again to find them. He got near to 
the tent flap and peeped in to invite them back up. Then a shout sounded.
 Astarion: “What in the Hells, Halsin! Go away! We’re busy!”
 Halsin: “Pardon me. When you’re finished, we’ll be waiting up at the top.”
 Tav: “Mm-… Yes. Yes, go, go. Mm.”
 Halsin turne around laughing to himself. Of course, this would happen with 
those two. It was his fault for not listening to his own words before. Now 
these two were sharing the same space. 
Astarion was a little annoyed once they were done. Tav was laughing but 
embarrassed. But then again, perhaps they should have waited after they 
discussed the topic at hand. Then again, the best way for Tav to relax was 
Astarion. For those who don’t know, happy chemicals in the brain and all. 
Astarion takes them through her blood, and Tav’s brain secretes them when 
he’s all up in her business. It was like taking 2 aspirins and a coke. Good 
stuff.
 Tav: “Oh, calm down my love. It’s not like he saw anything.”
 Astarion: “This time. He’s seen us before. I should start charging then. Put 
the drow twins to shame back at Baldur’s.”
 Tav: “Shut up! Hahahaha. I’d rather invest in doors and locks.”
 So, she fixed herself up by making sure her tunic was mess free and 
everything was back in place. Then she checked that he was proper, too. They
 were ready to head back out into the world, more relaxed than before. 
As they walked up, she took his hand in hers. She wanted the Tieflings to 
know that he was no danger to them and that they were together. She needed 
them to see that. She was still a little nervous about the whole ordeal, but that
 was good. Being brave is about knowing the impossibility of a desired 
outcome and still deciding to try and achieve it despite being afraid. She 
understood this. But, she was the impossible woman. She won the heart of a 
monster with love and dedication and he chose not to ascend. Two impossible
 things together at the same time. She had to try this next impossible feat. 
Perhaps the odds were indeed in her favor still. 
As they arrived, she lead Astarion near Okta and Halsin. The people just saw 
them walk up. She gave an aura as if she was some foreign queen and her 
monster king ready to offer a treaty and soldiers for the Tiefling plight. Some 
faces were surely eskeptical, but others were a bit more hopeful. 
Halsin: “Welcome again, friends! Come, sit here beside us. We have plenty to
 discuss.”
 Tav smiled and bowed to the people present. Astarion simply nodded and 
followed her lead. They headed to sit down and waited for the people to 
speak their minds first.
 Zevlor: “Tav, Astarion! Well met friends! I was told you had come back.”
 Tav: “Can I get a hug, dear friend?”
 He stood up and hugged her tightly. She was glad to see him again. 
Astarion: “With all honesty, I’m surprised to see you and your people still 
here. I would’ve thought you’d left after we took care of the goblin problem.”
 Zevlor: “Truth be told, I’m surprised, too. Thing is moving the people takes 
careful calculation, but Halsin told us to wait a while longer. He said it would
 be dangerous to be at Baldur’s Gate, so we waited. Then we heard word of 
the battle you all fought and we were certainly glad we waited. Then, you 
showed up out of nowhere. I’d say there is a divine hand here now.” 
Tav: “Well, I don’t know about divine anything, but I have ideas and I am 
really wanting to share them with you all. I just want you all to be safe. 
Baldur’s Gate is not the safe heaven you think it is, especially now that is in a
 bit of ruins. Tensions are high still and this was just about a month ago.”
 The people stirred and murmured. They had no choice but to believe it was 
true. They had just come from the city and it took them a month to get to the 
Grove. They figured had they been able to walk in daylight, they would have 
arrived sooner. 
Roland: “So, you came back here to help the refugees because of it?”
 Tav blushed a bit at the question. The reason was that she didn’t want to 
admit it, but she felt home here and didn’t want these people to leave the 
safety found at the grove for the discrimination of the city or cities. So, 
Astarion helped her a bit.
 Astarion: “In a way, yes. You see, Tav feels at home here. She met you all 
and fell in love with this place. I know her well enough to know she will put 
her life on the line again to keep it safe and keep you all safe-… much to my 
detriment.”
 Tav lifted her head, gathering courage from Astarion’s words. 
Tav: “My partner speaks truth. I had no home for many years, and I was 
welcomed here. Living in the darkness and shadows of the woods is possible,
 but the Grove showed me a beacon of light. If you let me, I want to be its 
champion and your blade, once more.”
 Halsin: “And yet I’m not surprised you’d drag Astarion to your cause. 
Hahaha.”
 She blushed, but she couldn’t function as well as she could without him. He 
focused her energy into something productive rather than simple survival.
 Okta: “Well, then let’s remember your proposition, Tav.”
 Tav: “Right. Well, I say we take the woods back from the varmin that is 
intent in destroying it. Build better defences to the walls of the grove, but not 
close off the grove. Fix and rebuild the town to better fit the needs of the 
people. Create spaces for farming to reduce the reliance of buying from 
Elturel, Scornuble, Triel, or Berdusk, but keep the options open for trade and 
commerce with those cities. Basically, create a safe heaven for all here and 
allow for expansion to receive more refugees who are looking for a place to 
settle down. I mean, some ideas to start.”
 One of the children spoke up.
 Bex: “You mean, make the grove our home? Forever?”
Tav: “I mean allow all to have the freedom to choose where they want to 
settle, while also taking care of the woods and the Grove for future 
generations to come.”
 Rolan: “That is-… very ambitous. But how would that be done?”
 Tav: “Well, first step is accept to listen to the proposal. Second step is 
planning it out. It cannot be done in a day or a couple of days. It is a long
term project. It will need dedication and the willing participation of many.”
 Findal: “Well, I am with you all the way, Tav. Hadn’t it been for you all, my 
corpse would be rotting in a cave.”
 Zorru: “Why do I get the feeling you’re aiming for a sort of farming 
community? Is this what your plan entails?”
 Tav: “YES! That’s the word I was looking for. Yes, a sort of farming 
community taking into account the care and preservation of the sacred 
ground. Take what is needed and give back. When coming here, I saw the 
outskirts of Berdusk’s fields. Sure, for them it’s a large city, so they take more
 than they need, but we can work together to have more than enough for all 
and also tend to the forest. She needs us. It’s full of varmin and she wheeps. 
We have to do something to give back and she can take care of us, too.”
 Halsin: “This is a side of you I never had the honor to see before. Are you 
sure you aren’t druid, my dear Tav?”
 Tav: “I don’t know what I am. But, I do know that I feel it in my bones. I 
know it sounds insane, but I don’t know-… something pulls me to this insane
 plan. Save the forest. She’ll save you. I have to try. I beg thee to at least see 
my side before discarding the proposition.”
Okta: “I’ve never seen someone with such conviction to fight for something 
so impossible. It’s refreshing. I am with you then. You seem honest enough 
and letting go of so much gold-… it forces me to at least give you a chance.”
 Tav breathed a sigh. That’s two down, perhaps with Halsin that makes three, 
but she needed more to rally. 
Tav: “I know it feels like I am imposing myself on the land. I apologize, but 
that is not my intention. I am seeking an alliance with the two factions that 
reside here. I seek an alliance with the Druids, the rightful guardians of the 
Reaching Woods, and I seek an alliance with the Tiefling clan who has been 
granted shelter here at Emeral Grove. I am offering all I have, my bow, my 
sword, and myself to regain the forest from deviant control and to help create
 a safe haven for all wanderers like myself and refugees. Faerun has forced us 
to the fringe of life for long enough. I want to dedicate my life to make space 
for all of us. A space that if taken care of, it will take care of us. I now it’s not
 something that sounds beliavable, but doesn’t it make sense? We just have to 
band together.”
 Cal: “But what about the spawns you mentioned? That’s a lot of vampires 
running about.”
 Tav: “I agree with you and I also understand your point. This is where the 
second part of the plan starts. If you all agree, you have my gold to begin 
with whatever is needed to help fortify the area first. Send scout missions to 
buy supplies at Scornubel or Berdusk. In the mean time, Astarion and I will 
clear out any remaining goblins and recuperate the entrance to the 
Underdark.”
 Rikka: “You mean Selune’s Temple?”
 Tav: “Who? I guess, I don’t really remember the place from last time we 
were here, but sure. The thing is that it is a good place for my kin to be. Close
 enough to the Grove.”
 Locke: “What is your plan exactly there?”
 Tav: “We, Astarion and I, go in. Clean house. Then find a spot where we can 
start a settlement similar to this one, but under-… over there. And offer them 
guidance to learn to be human again. Those people, my kin, are also refugees,
 but of a different kind. They need help, they need support, and they need the 
benefit of a doubt. I gave Astarion a chance and today I trust him with my 
life, my soul even. I am sure that there can be plenty of them that just want a 
chance at living again.”
 Zevlor: “You remind me of me months ago, but with a much better plan. 
You’re not doing this for you. You are doing this for three groups of people 
for nothing but the idea that they can all work together.”
 Tav: “Yes! I know that together we can force Faerun to make space for all of 
us. Our children deserve a safe place to live. We all do. We deserve to live, to 
love, to learn-… We desrive to thrive despite our differencres. I know that 
together, even if it’s hard, we can do it. We’ve defeated the brain. I know we 
can reclaim this corner for all of us to pursuit happiness and peace.”
 Umi: “You said the vampire spawn are your kin? Are you also a vampire?”
Tav: “What? Uh-… no. None of them can make more vampires. Astarion 
killed the vampire that made them. I burned his palace down to cinders so 
he’s not returning. They are now free from control, but they can’t spread the 
curse.”
 Mol: “Do you want to be a vampire?”
 Tav: “What? Uh-… not really. It’s not a priority to be honest. My beloved is 
one, but he’s never pushed the topic.
 Halsin: “Children, perhaps stop asking Tav about her private matters and lets 
return to the topic at hand.”
 Tav gave him a look of relief. She didn’t want to scare the folks regarding 
vampiric neccessities. 
Tav: “I’ll tell you what. Right now, I do not have the time, but how about you
 make a list of questions regarding the topic. And I’ll work hard to make the 
time to come and answer them. I think that it is important to pass information
 of my kin. Now, they are my kin because Astarion is my mate and he is one. 
So, the spawn are my kin by connection, not by cursed passed. Is that fair?”
 The kids shook their heads to agree. They were now added to the list of allies.
 Tav’s willingness to answer and to offer something she didn’t have to made 
them feel important and special. They got the feeling that she could side with 
them against the adults. Most kids didn’t want to leave the Grove. 
Zevlor: “Why do I get the feeling you are planning on rallying the spawn to 
take care of the gnoll problem.?”
 Astation sat up straight. He wasn’t even aware of that part. He thought to 
himself: 
So, that’s why she took them down. The mad woman was gaging strength. 
She took 2 down easily and she overpowered the large one. If we train the 
spawn properly, we have an army of spawn hunting for food. It’s an 
ambitous plan, but it might just work. As long as we send foot soldiers at 
night time and force them to keep off the necks of our allies here. 
He smiled as he made the connection before she explained it. He had a 
feeling she had thought of it very recently otherwise she would’ve ran it by 
him by now. Tav gave a coy smile.
 Tav: “Also, yes. Astarion and I have to go to the Underdark first. We need to 
talk to those who will listen and make the same offer, the same treaty. But 
with them, they would be brought up top to help with the clearing at night, as 
you here stay safe. Basically, we attack the other ones all day and all night. 
They will be overwhelmed and we can keep the assault going until they are 
eliminated or they flee. Either way, we gain territory and we recuperate the 
forest.”
Halsin: “I am with you, friends. I will hold a council with the others and see 
what we should do to start. Zevlor, Okta, I suggest you do the same. Figure 
out who wants to stay and fight and who wants to continue to Baldur’s Gate.”
 Tav: “I sure hope that you give me a chance if the decision is to keep going to
 Baldur’s Gate. I’ll arrange for an escort. I don’t like the idea of you all going,
 but I don’t want you to be attacked on your way.”
 And like that the proposal was given. It was a very rough outline about what 
she was planning, but she was sure passionate when presenting it. 
The people slowly began to go back to their bed rolls and tents. Tav and 
Astaroin stayed there a little longer just looking at the fire in silence. It was a 
bold plan, but talking about it now would serve no purpose. They all had to 
let it simmer a bit longer. Then after a couple of minutes, they stood and left.
 Once at the tent, Astarion helped her make a little fire for her to heat up some
 food. She hadn’t eaten all day despite him feeding on her. Now that they had 
presented the proposal, she trully felt the hunger crash into her. He watched 
her eat and sway side to side as she enjoyed her meal. 
The people moved about the rest of the night. They found a place where they 
could freshen up making sure the water wouldn’t hurt him. Then as the sky 
started to change, they went back in the tent. 
Now it was just a waiting game again. She knew she had some folks on her 
side and at least the leaders had joined in her insane plan. Perhaps in the 
morning they would continue siding with her. With any luck, that wil stay the
 same until night for tomorrow night, they head into the dark.
