CHAPTER 14 In your marks, get set,…
 As she’s kissing him, the fire lives inside her ignited ten fold. His energy was
 reciprocal. They had just buried the hatchet on a topic that had been lingering
 since before Baludur’s Gate exit. 
They had been in a back and forth about their true feelings for months now, 
and you can only carry on for so long until you have to stop playing and 
address it.
 What we now know, she loves a man that’s been cursed. She refuses to let 
him go. She acknowledges it will be difficult for them every single day to be 
together. She understands that her love is hard work, but for her it’s 
rewarding.
 As for our Lord Astarion Ancunin, it will be a difficult journey ahead. You 
can’t fix trauma in less than a year, but you can take it one day at a time. 
Now, he’s come clean about his actions and feelings, so it’s up to him to put 
in the work to help himself. No one can do it for him, not anymore. She 
already threw him a life line. He took it. He will need to climb out of the hole
 he was trapped in, but for now, all is well.
 He allowed her to take control of the moment. She pinned him down and 
stradled him as she kissed his lips with an urgency, as if he was going to 
disappear if she didn’t take him now. As she laid her kisses, she placed them 
on his forehead, on each of his closed eyes, on his cheeks, on the tip of his 
nose and once again on his lips. As if each kiss was a blessing from her to 
ensure he never forgot he was loved and by no one more than him. 
She slid down to kiss his neck. She could smell his faint scent. It was clear to 
her what all the stories said about his kind, but to her, he was home. She 
loved her home and the scent of home. And he enjoyed being the one being 
loved. Years of torture and servitude, be dammed. Now it was him who was 
going to receive the attention, because to her, he was worth it.
 She stopped and sat up straight as she was still on top of him, her strong legs 
pinning him down on each side. Her whole body on top of his strong 
stomach, with his hands grabbing her by the waist. 
She needed to look at him there, being loved by her. His soft white curls 
messy now. His ruby red eyes looking up at her beaming up with joy. His 
soft smile with a hing of fangs. He was the most beautiful man she’d ever 
seen. There she swore that anything and everything she would do from this 
point onward was to erase the demons of the past and focus on the brightness 
of their future. 
It would become her life’s work to ensure he never felt less than nor dream of
 his torture. He will live. He will be loved. And he will thrive. After all, she 
was the impossible woman and that was her expertise; to to the impossible. 
Tav with a loving smile told him as much.
 “Astarion. You are the most beautiful man I’ve ever seen. Let me love you. 
Let me share my happiness with you.”
 He was shocked for despite everything that had happened recently and 
months back, he’d never expected those words to come out of anyone’s 
mouth, even hers. His face showed as much. 
“I will never leave you, my moon and stars.”, she said as she leaned in to kiss
 him again.
 As if her spell was almost complete. Her touch, her kisses, her words, all 
meant to become a barrier on his skin, on his very essence. As if her soul 
finally was ready to take him in and give him back the soul which had been 
stolen. Now they would share one spark. One could not exist without the 
other. That was her claim. He was hers. She was his. And that’s how it had to
 be.
 As a tear rolled down the side of his eye, he spoke, but it wasn’t easy. He was
 overcome with emotion for this woman was showing him that he was there. 
He exists. He is loved. He matters. And no other woman will ever love him 
more than her. His Tav.
 “Tav-… thank you.”
 “I’ll take that as a ‘Yes, I concur.’ That’s all I needed to hear, my Astarion.”
 She kissed him again with even more urgency. Her lips traveled from his lips 
to his neck, shoulders even. At one point, she lightly nipped at his skin. Small
 little bites not intended to hurt, but her dominance was obvious. She was 
ensuring that he understood that he had been claimed and the only way she 
knew how was how it was done in the wild. Animals bite. 
Every time she had a little nibble, he’d giggle for he never thought of doing it
 himself, on her. Besides, she was rather ticklish and at times he had to pull 
back a little or she’d not be able to breathe from laughter. But now, no tickles
 seemed to faze her. 
She kept moving down, going back up and going back down again. Every 
surface available would be kissed or nibbled on. She started on his right side. 
His cool skill touched by fiery lips from his shoulders down to his arm. She 
kissed his wrist, turned his hand over and kissed the top of his hand. Then she
 kissed his knuckles. Finally, she took his right hand and placed it on her 
cheek. The coolness of his touch felt like a delicious caress of a winter 
breeze. She closed her eyes and smiled at the feeling. Her face full of bliss. 
Then she carefully placed his hand down. He moved it back to her thigh and 
began to massage it softly moving his thumbs in a circular motion. He was 
enjoying this more than the other thousands of bodies he’d been forced to 
seduce. This time he was the one being seduced, loved, taken care of. 
“Mm-… Tav. Don’t stop.”
 “Shush. I’m busy.”, she said as she started kissing his collar bones and neck 
again. 
She was enjoying this as much as him, perhaps more. This was the first time 
she dared take the lead for real. And she was doing everything that felt good. 
She bit his left shoulder a little to hard and he winced a little. 
“I’m so sorry!”, she said in a panic.
 “Don’t stop.”, he purred with his eyes closed. He certainly didn’t mind.
 She kissed him extra where she had bitten him a little too hard and he gave 
her a little moan. He was really feeling his oats right about now. She 
continued kissing his arms, as if every muscle line he had must be kissed lest 
they demand it. Finally, she kissed his left wrist, turned his hand over, kissed 
the top of his hand and finally kissed his knuckles. Then again placed his 
hand on her cheek. The happiness this caused her was overwhelming. 
“I love you my star.”
 He smiled in full bliss with his eyes closed. 
She placed his arm down carefully once more and he placed this hand right 
on her thigh. Then she leaned forward to kiss his chest, kissing every part of 
his chest from side to side. The feeling of his skin on her hot face was the 
best feeling, like she was burning, but he couldn’t, so he kept her fire 
contained. This meant, she could enjoy this feeling for longer. She even 
nibbled on his nipples causing him to open his eyes in surprise.
 “Oh! I wasn’t-…” 
“Shush it. I’ll move down”
 She did just that. Kiss after kiss, she was memorizing his every fiber, every 
scar, every blemish, nothing was going to be left unattended. She needed to 
memorize him all from top to bottom. And then she got to his waist line. By 
this she was no longer on top of him, but she could smell herself on his skin. 
This was still warm. She looked back at him.
 “My love. Can I?”, she said as she tugged at his pants, which was the only 
thing he had been wearing. That and his underwear. 
“Yes, my love.”
 He didn’t bother opening his eyes. He simply aided by lifting his body just 
enough to slide the pants and underwear off. She did this slowly for she 
didn’t want to hurt him. Not that she could, but he deserved the best care.
 Then she continued her map of kisses, through ever valley and hill that she 
could find. She first did his right side from his hip bone down to his little 
white toes. The knee nibble made him give a little jolt. It’s not every day that 
your knees are kissed. Then his right side was given the same care.
 “How can you be so beautiful my star.”, she said as she looked at him with 
his arms behind his head and a stupid happy look on his face.
 She nudged him to turn around. He was reluctant. She bit his calf hard. He 
obliged.
 “I’m memorizing. Let me work.”, she said.
 As she saw his broad back covered in the horrid scars, she wondered if one 
day her plan with Gale would work. It was her hope to offer him the removal 
of this if he wanted, but for now, they were working on it.
 She got on top of him again. She wanted to smell his hair. It smelled like 
you’d expect a vampire to smell like along with the soap they had at hand. It 
smelled like citronella. Then she kissed the tip of his ears and he bounced a 
little as he laughed into the pelts. Then she whispered into his ear.
 “You are my beautiful.”
 She continued kissing the sides of his neck and she once more went down to 
kiss his scars on his back. Once she got to his butt, she couldn’t help herself 
and bit him. He jumped a little again. 
“Sorry. It’s just there asking for it. Don’t worry, I’ll bite the other so they 
don’t fight.”
 He laughed as she did just that. Not a bite to cause harm, just light enough for
 him to feel it. Then she continued down to his legs and to the back of his 
knees. Here she blew hard. And laughed. She like how it felt. Him not so 
much. 
Every part of his body was covered in her soft kisses and he was finally 
learning what pure bliss felt like. 
Then she nudged him to turn over again. He did so without protest this time.
 “My love? May I-… try?” she asked shyly. She was about to try what he had 
no issue in doing for her, but for her, it was another first.
 “Are you sure, Tav? You don’t have to.”
 “Are you enjoying yourself yes or no, Astarion?”, she said with light 
annoyance.
 “Yes.”, he said while stifling a laugh. 
She wasn’t experienced, but she was thorough and creative, he gave her that 
much. 
“I’ll take that as my ‘yes’.”
She took her inexperienced hands and took hold of him and began to move 
up and down his shaft slowly. This time she was more careful not to hurt 
him. He gave a little moan. She kept doing this.
 Then she leaned in to kiss the head and the shaft. She was still in memorizing
 mode, so she had to lay kissing on the missing area. As she did this, she took 
notice that he surely noticed the attention.
 Now she was ready to do what she had planned. She opened her mouth 
tentatively and allowed him in little by little. She used her tongue to caress 
his tip first. Then she went down the shaft. He felt cold, but hard. He was 
ready, but she wasn’t. Not yet. 
She took her right hand and cupped his testicles and softly moved her fingers 
to let them move just enough. Another moan escaped his throat. 
For someone that is copying my moves, she is surprisingly good. I’ll
 make her better. 
This thought made him smile wide. She mistook it for an invitation, so she 
took him in fully. Aided by her hands and her inexperienced tongue, she 
moved her head to go deep and back.
 “Oh, Tav-… Mmm-…”, he moaned in pleasure.
 She was thrilled. He always did these sort of thing for her and now she felt 
the courage to gift it back. She focused on his taste. Everything was to be 
memorized today. She needed to make sure he was real and she wasn’t 
dreaming.
 He placed his hands on her head to guide her, but with his strength, he was 
able to move her faster and faster. Enough to not let her move fast enough. 
She took him and swallowed.
 “Oh, Tav, I’m sorry! I got carried aw-…” 
She laughed, “It’s okay. It’s all in a day’s work.”
 “A lunatic.”, he mused.
 “May I, my love?”, she asked. She was ready to take him.
 “Mm-… Yes.”, his voice barely a whisper for now she was on top of him.
 She took his hands and placed them on her hips.
 “Steady me. I’m going it.”
 He smiled and rolled his eyes. You’d think she’d be more sensual, but she 
was exhausted before. Now, she was like any drunk, inhibitions be dammed. 
She was free of her mind to feel pleasure and offer him her pleasure, too. 
Their temperature difference was now truly obvious. His undeath was cool 
but her fire was untamed. She lifted her self just enough to guide him to the 
correct position and allowed him to slide in slowly. She gasped. She clasped. 
He gasped. He buckled. He was in. She took a deep breath and exhaled. 
“Steady me.”, she whispered as she began to move allowing her body to feel 
that jolt of energy she always felt with him around. Up and down, then in a 
circular motion. 
This is new. Circular motion. I’ll keep that in mind, my love. 
He thought right before she began to pick up speed and he couldn’t help 
himself.
 “Oh, gods! Tav, don’t stop.”
 “Mm-… yes, no… mm” 
He saw how her skin turned more red the faster she was moving. Then she 
grabbed his hands and placed them on her breasts. 
“Astarion-… Mmm-… Ah-… Yes! Yes! Yes!”
 He had begun to play with her breasts and squeezed her nipples lightly. Her 
speed didn’t slow down. She was almost there. But, looking at her, eyes 
closed, smile on her face, wet curls bouncing, her caramel skin, like a 
goddess gifted to him, he felt how his body had a mind of its own and joined 
her rhythm. He was singing right along with her. 
“Tav-… Mm-…” 
She’d push down, he’d push up, and they would meet half way. Her body 
choking him. And as he thrust and she hugged him tight, they began to feel 
that burst of energy that comes one your bliss is no longer contained. And 
like a chorus in unison, they let their bodies become one. They let their soul 
finally complete their merge. As her back arched and his hips went up to 
meet her, the felt the release of their passion. Her fire finally consumed him. 
They were one.
 She finally gave him the last ounce of energy she had. She smiled at him and 
leaned in to caress his cheek. 
With a sleepy voice, she crooned, “You’re the most beautiful man I’ve ever 
seen-… and you’re mine. I love you, Astarion Ancunin.”
 “And I love you, Tav Storm.”, he said in a softest voice.
 But she gave a little jolt. A sort of little panic, swift enough for most to 
simply ignore, but he wasn’t most. She smiled to try to cover up that reaction,
 and instead gave him a light kiss on the lips.
 She removed herself from his body and laid beside him. He was feeling too 
much bliss to ask him ‘what was that?’, but he’d keep a note about it for later.
As they lay there, he listened for her breathing. He enjoyed her life. He 
noticed how her heart beat slowly went down and so did her breathing. To be 
the one that caused that in her was surely the gift he was grateful for. So, with
 her, he allowed himself to relax and fall asleep. 
Tav was the only person that managed to make him fall asleep as opposed to 
the common trance of his people. But he wasn’t complaining. He liked this 
bliss. His home, his woman, just two naked bodies that now will share one 
soul until the end of time. What more could a man ask for?
 Besides, by now it was around 6pm and sunset wouldn’t be for another our. 
They could rest now. He fixed his arm around her to allow her a more 
comfortable position. Then he too closed his eyes. No dreams. Just rest. 
As the time progressed, she could feel a little colder. She began to stir. She 
saw him in his peaceful rest and smiled. She moved in to give him a peck on 
the cheek. This woke him. He opened his eyes.
 “Mm-… Hello, darling. Is it time?”, he asked a bit groggily.
 “I think so. But I feel well. How are you feeling, my love?”
 “Better than ever. Amazing, I think.”
 “Good, because we have work to do. I bet is dark out now. Let me go see.”
 She stood up, wearing nothing for her smile and walked over to the flap. He 
couldn’t take his eyes of her. She carefully opened it and sure enough, he was
 free to move about. It was dark out. 
“Let’s get dressed! It’s night time.”, she chimed.
 “Great. I need to stretch outside. But first”
 He patted his hand as he moved a little back. He looked at her seductively as 
he told her to get back to bed. She flushed but gave a little giggle and quickly
walked back to lay beside him.
 He embraced her with his marble arms and she rejoiced in the coolness of his
 skin. 
“Mm-… You always feel so nice.”, she said as she wiggled her body to be 
perfectly nestled in his. 
“Likewise, my dear.”, he whispered in her ear. 
“Careful, Astarion. We’ve got work to do. No distractions.”
 She said as she kept wiggling her body into his, enjoying the skin to skin. He 
tightened his arms around her to keep her from wiggling so much. She 
laughed.
 “For someone who is claiming no distractions, you surely are distracting.”
 “Fine. Let go and I’ll get dressed.”
 “No. I don’t think I will.”
 “You won’t, will ya?!”
 She wiggled some more and he laughed. Then he kissed her neck. His touch 
there always did the trick. It was his spot after all.
 “Mm-… Astarion.”, she moaned as she gripped to his forearm so tightly that 
her nails left indentations on his skin. 
“I thought as much, beloved.”
 He nuzzled his nose on her hair and took in her scent. She was clearly 
enjoying herself. She had been exhausted before, but now rested, her mind 
was clear, and she clearly was into relinquishing her dominance back to him. 
He moved his right hand to her thigh and began to caress her skin. Clearly 
intent on leaving goose-pimples on her skin due to the coolness of his touch.
She smiled, eyes closed and she shifted her body backwards, further showing 
him that she wanted to be close and stay as close as possible. This was his 
cue to move his hand forward and find her belly. He left it there long enough 
for her to react. She lifted her right leg on top of his. He caressed her belly in 
circles as he breathed in the scent in her hair once more. 
They were now free to love each other like any healthy couple does. So, yes, 
they want to have a bit a fun again, and we’re going to let them. Stop being a 
prude. If you don’t’ want to watch, skip ahead. For the rest of us, let’s enjoy 
their love unfold.
 Her scent was an aphrodisiac to him. She smelled alive. She was the sun 
made flesh and she was his. What joy for him to have the sun back in the 
form of his woman, Tav. He moaned as his senses were hightening and he 
could feel how her heart beat was faster, her breathing was heavy, and her joy
 could be felt on his own skin. 
He moved his hand from her belly, some centimeters lower, finding what he 
was looking for. As soon as his cool fingers found her little bump, she her 
hips buckled backwards and she giggled, then allowed her body to feel the 
pleasure her man was providing. He was an expert after all, but now retired, 
thankfully. He smiled and then decided to nibble on her ear. 
“Astarion! Mm-… Like that. Mmm… Yes… Yes…”, she managed to say as 
her own hips were starting to move on their own accord. 
He let her move, for her friction was rubbing on his own pleasure. Their 
movements were soft, with intention. The had all the time in the universe 
right now, because now, the universe stopped time to let them be. Let them 
be in love, feel their love. 
Gone were the days of the corruption they suffered. They were elves, of 
course they like to make love, it is in their nature. But now, they are free to 
enjoy like Halsin once said, “enjoy the freedoms of nature’s gifts.” And now 
Tav understands what Halsin meant, though to Halsin’s detriment, she was 
only for Astarion and Astarion’s touch only. Wop Wop for Halsin. 
As Astarion’s expert fingers moved in circular motions, he enjoyed his song 
bird’s son. There was nothing better than his name on her lips, especially like
 this. But his concentration was short lived, for he felt her pushing back. She 
was getting desperate. Or in other words, he had her right where he needed.
 “Astarion-… Mm-… please.”, she pleaded as her right leg pulled him closer 
to her.
 “Anything for you my love.”, he whispered in her ear.
 He used his hand to position her properly to be penetrated, but he was going 
to take his sweet time doing so. This was his “signature” on the soul contract 
she signed four hours ago. Now it was his turn to finish this dance, but he 
was going to enjoy every second of it.
 Besides, he already knew that her tightness would end his efforts all too 
quickly and he wasn’t about to let her finish him too fast. Not right now. 
So, he positioned himself outside of her first and began to thrust. His friction 
felt and noticed by the song she kept singing. Much to Tav’s surprise she 
didn’t expect herself to be so, should we say, noisy. Not shouts, but soft 
moans of pleasure that she wasn’t able to hide, nor she should. He loved her 
song and she couldn’t help but sing. So, don’t judge them, you prude. 
Besides, right now the Drow twins back at Baldur’s could take a note or two 
on seduction or singing classes. 
Then Astarion finally moved himself enough to enter. She used her own hand
 to guide him in correctly, but her body was making it difficult to hold on. She
 was pretty much out there, somewhere in the universe watching the stars, for 
her body was on fire, for him.
 He felt as her tight walls enveloped him like a tight fitting glove. It felt 
amazing, he thought. He placed his lips to her shoulder to stifle his own 
pleasure. He didn’t want to let lose, just yet. So once he was in, he stopped 
moving. He had to collect himself, first. Too bad, Tav didn’t get that 
message, for her own hips began to move.
 “Careful, Tav. I’m not done, yet.”
 “Mm-… ss-… sorry. I can’t stop it.”
 “Gods! I love you woman!”
 As soon as he said this he began to thrust. He was done keeping control of his
 body and just let his hips do the dancing. Hers were keeping up with his pace.
 Then he moved his hand back to her belly and pressed hard enough for her to 
feel, but not enough to hurt.
 “Astarion-…”
 “Tav-…”
 They quickened their pace, as she held on to his left arm hugging her from 
under while his right hand kept a firm grasp on her belly. 
They both understood that they would never be able to bring forth life, but 
they could always pretend, in the privacy of their home, that perhaps they 
would some day. Different folks will deal with their grief in a way that works
 for them, and for these two broken love-birds, this was fine. A hand on a 
barren belly that would never hold life, and the seed of a cursed man robbed 
from giving it. But their love for each other will help them navigate their 
truth.
 As he quickened his pace, he held on just long enough to let her reach it first. 
He knew that his reward would be far greater if he managed to hold on. And 
true enough, she climaxed first, he hips buckled back, her walls tightened 
further. If he was snug before, now he was practically choked, he reached as 
far as she would go, and finally let go. Both felt how their bodies, as sensitive
 as they were, enjoyed becoming one. He felt his release inside her, and her 
body took in as much as it could. The rest, would have to run down.
 Their bodies went limp. She was the first to speak.
 “My love, we’re not going to get anything done like this.”
 “Oh, I know. Is this you complaining? You are doing a horrible job?”
 “You wish I’d complain. Heck! I’ll not complain just to spite you.”
 “Is that so, Tav? We’ll just see about that.”
 He have a little thrust forward. He was limp, but he wasn’t out just yet.
 “Oh-… Mm-… You win. You win.”, she breathed. 
If she let him convince her for another round, she’d have to sleep another 4 
hours and it was 10 pm by now. As much as she wanted to stay like that 
forever, they had to finish up their preparation. 
He laughed and kissed her shoulder. Then he slid out and finally let her go. 
She sat up and looked back at him. She touched his face and smiled.
 “The most beautiful man.”
 He just closed his eyes as he allowed himself to be caressed and be told sweet
 nothings. It was pure bliss.
 “Very well, let me get dressed. You need to get dressed, too. I need your 
help. It’s ALL HANDS ON DECK!”, she said with fire and determination in 
her eyes.
She had used up 2 hours of prep time, and they had to make it up. 
“Mm-… I love this side of you, Tav. So, Captain, my Captain, what is on the 
log tonight?”, he teased her. 
“Well, lots of things and gossip. I haven’t told you about my shenanigans.”
 She said this as she was now rummaging her pack to find a fresh set of 
clothes for herself and for him. She got what she needed and walked back to 
him. He was mesmerized by her. If he didn’t know any better, he could swear
 he could see sunlight radiating from her bronze skin. She truly was her sun in
 the darkness. And he was her beloved moon in the middle of the chaotic 
darkness. They were meant to be one. 
“Here you go. Hey, did you know that I love you?”, she said with a bright 
smile as she handed him his clothes. 
“What-… Yes,-… and I-… I love you more than life itself.”,  he said a bit 
shyly.
 “Well, don’t forget it. I do. Now, come on. Off the bed. Get a move on.”, she 
ushered him of the pelts. 
He stood up and began to get dressed, too. Socks, underwear, leather pants, 
shirt. He was done. She was not far off, either. They weren’t going to wear 
any armor at the moment. She took her favorite vest, yes, that one, you know 
which one. She put it on without a bra, decided against that, took it off, put 
one on, and then put the vest top back on. He just looked at her, very 
entertained. She noticed and blushed. After all this time, and she will 
probably never stop. His loving gaze will always have that reaction on her 
and she will always feel that energy jolt when he does. Mr. and Mrs. Misery 
have evolved their love language and we bore witness to it. Isn’t that lovely. 
Once they were done getting dressed, Astarion opened the tent flaps and 
fastened them to the inside with some sewn straps on the inside. Like this, 
they could go in and out freely. So, now they were ready to begin their day…
 or better yet, their night. 
Tav said with unconstrained enthusiasm, “First of all, I got us a trip across 
the river! It’s paid for and everything.”
 “Really?! That’s fantastic. But, how exactly?”, he closed his eyes a bit 
skeptical.
 He knew her well enough to know some shenanigans indeed had to take 
place for her to be so excited to talk about it.
 “Oh, you know. I little of this a little of that. And Boom! Got us a ride!”
 She laughed. 
So, she proceeded to tell him every little detail from when she headed to the 
river with her little cart and everything after that.
 “When I got to the river, I was scouting what was in the area, plants, my 
rocks, boats, patrols, everything. So, as I was there, a fishing boat was 
nearing me heading towards Berdusk. I got their attention and there was a 
Hellrider guard, a woman tiefling, with them. She got into a boat and a 
fisherman, Damian-… Diego-… I don’t recall, got into the boat and came to 
shore with me. I gave them my shpeel about being this poor peasant woman 
who was with child, but needed some aid.”
 “I’m sure you are. So, what was your lie exactly?”
 She blushed and looked at the floor instead for this part. 
“You are my cursed albino husband named Rupert. Your affliction has you 
shy away from sunlight. You’ll need to wear your dark glasses once we 
leave, by the way. So, we have been married for a bit, we have been trying to 
get pregnant, and we have had 2 lost babies. We are on our third attempt, but 
I’m delicate. You do what you can, but can’t do it in day light. You blame 
yourself for my losses, but in reality it’s probably my ‘dry’ womb.”
 His mouth fell open, his eyes widened in shock. Then the air managed to get 
back into him so he could talk.
“Tav! That’s-… I’m-… I mean-…”
 He couldn’t help himself, he began to laugh and then to cackle. I mean, she 
didn’t lie, but she did lie. Clever woman. He continued.
 “Well, it worked-… But, RUPERT! OF ALL THE NAMES! RUPERT!”
 “I also, said you get all red like cooked shrimp in the sun because it burns 
your skin.”, she sheepishly said this while still looking at the floor, but trying 
to find her flowers.
 She figured this was a good time to recycle them to apologize. She found 
them. He was too stunned to speak long enough for her to grab the flowers 
and get on one knee in front of him offering the sad flowers while smiling at 
him.
 “Shrimpstarion, my beloved Rupert. I apologize. Can you forgive my 
insolence in naming you so poorly, my grace?”, she said in a teasing voice. 
After all, she had been learning form his theatrics for about a year now. He 
was still too stunned to speak.
 This woman is definitely the end of me. The sun temple was one thing, but 
she took the challenge to improve her nonsensical ways! And I love her?!
 His thoughts only gave way for another laughing fit. He took his flowers 
again, and helped her stand up. He kissed her forehead and hugged her.  He 
was finally able to talk again. 
“I am too shocked to even have an opinion, but I’m glad it worked. Just, 
don’t call me those horrid names. I’m offended.” he teased her while 
pretending to be deeply offended. 
She smiled and got on her tip toes to give him a quick peck on the lips. 
“I won’t. I promise. On my ranger’s honor, I will never call you those names 
directly.”, she giggled as she got free from his arms and began to walk 
towards the outside. 
He followed her out and stretched his back and arms. Then took a deep 
breath and gagged. 
“What in the hells?!”
 “That’s my food fish. I don’t like fish either, but-…”
 He cut her off. 
“Food is food. I know. I know. So, that’s your price to pay for your buckets.”
 “You know it. But with the salt and the smoke, it will be fine. I still got some 
parchment paper. I just need it to dry as much as possible. Can you add more 
wood and stuff?”
 “Of course, let me see what I can find around.”
 “Be careful, love. I see shadows.”
 “I think they are more afraid of us.”
 “I know, but we got work to do. I mean, don’t bring trouble over. We’re 
busy.”
 “Oh, that. Sure thing. Be back in a bit.”
 She hated to see him go, but he was more than capable to go and find wood. 
Also, it was likely that he was a bit peckish, so he needed the excuse. As he 
left, she began to set up little work stations to make the tasks easier. 
Very well. We got the clothes pile, the fish pile, the log, my fish scales… 
What else? I think first the fish-… Never mind. I’ll go get the water skin first 
and the basin. Then the fish pile goes first, so I can free up my cart. I’ll just 
ask Astarion to help me with the clothes line before I beg him to help with my
 arrow shafts. He’s going to hate it! Ha ha ha
 So, she walked inside the tent and then to the little tent on the side. Yes, that 
one tent that she gave a stupid name to. No, there’s no need to repeat “poop 
tent” for it’s for poop, pee, and bathing. It’s a bathroom tent. You know it, I 
know it, we all know it. Yes, we are 13 years old ant that makes us giggle. 
Anyway, she headed inside and grabbed the water skin from earlier, the basin
 which was basically a wooden bowl, and the used wash rag, then walked 
back outside. She placed the things on the cart and Helen squeaked a little. 
She was heavy, but wouldn’t for long. 
Tav went back inside to get a bit of soap to wash the basin. Then she rinsed it
 and threw the water away from camp. She placed the salted fish on the large 
bowl she had placed on the floor. Then loosened the knots he had made 
before and carefully removed the burlap sack to not spill any salt. 
As she was working on the fish, she saw Astarion with a bit of blood on his 
shirt and carrying several sticks of wood and a small log he clearly had 
ripped from a branch of a tree.
 “Welcome back my love. How was the menu?”
 “Horrid, but it will do.”, he smiled as the placed the wood near the fire. 
As he began to move about, she stopped what she was doing to observe him. 
That amazing man of hers, read her mind. 
“Let me make you a dying rack for your fish. I’ll set it up next to the fire. 
Hopefully, it can keep the smoke here and not so much everywhere.”
 “I love you, you beautiful intelligent man! It’s perfect! I’ll get going on the 
laundry then. But-…”, she pointed to the shirt. 
“Oh, yeah. Sure. We don’t want the stain to set in.”, he said as he removed 
his shirt. 
He didn’t bother putting on another. She certainly wouldn't mind. When it 
came to him, she would also outlaw clothing. 
He continued to make the simple rack. She had handed him some leather 
straps, which knowing Tav, she’d probably have a sack full of them. Straps, 
rope, and twine. First he carefully pushed down the four main sticks in the 
ground. The ones closer to the fire were left a little higher out. Then the other
 two sticks would go on each side. It looked like the frame of a table without 
the top flat part. He secured the sticks to each other with the straps and placed
 some twine in a zig-zag pattern to support the burlap sack once he placed it 
there. So that was his next plan. 
He took the sack while making faces. He hated fish smell. He tied one side of
 it to the horizontal stick, then the other side. Finally, he placed the fish from 
the bowl on top making sure that it would hold. He didn’t want to pick out 2 
kilos worth of fish nor waste her efforts. Once he was done, like classic 
Astarion, he boasted that his work was once again perfect. His gloating 
would be short lived though. 
While he was fussing over stinky fish, Tav was setting up her washing 
station. She had loosed Helen free, and had carefully moved her towards the 
side of the smaller tent. Yes, that one. Anyway, once there, she took one of 
the buckets down and left it a little of to the side. She also placed the large 
water skins on the ground and placed the wooden bowl in the cart. She added 
soap to the bucket she had left in the cart too. Then she went to get the 
clothes. Then she reached from under the little tent to grab her little twig mat.
 She placed the dirty clothes on it to keep the dirt to a minimal amount. 
Every so often, she glanced towards Astarion to see his progress, but once 
she saw him begin to gloat, she shut that shit down.
 “That’s amazing! But, can you help me with a clothes line, please?”
 “Oh, fine. One can’t be allowed to gloat in peace.”, he said with fake 
annoyance.
 She giggled. 
“Love you. Thanks.”
 “Yeah, yeah. I love you, too.”, he said as he took off again into the darkness 
to bet more sticks. He had his plan and she would let him figure it out. She 
was busy herself.
 So, she figured she had to start without the clothes line. She would just have 
to leave the soapy clothes on the cart or the twig-mat first. Then once 
everything was washed, she’d begin to rinse. By then, the clothes line would 
be ready. 
And that’s exactly what she did. Scrub, scrub, on the socks, and undies. She 
had a hard bristle brush that she used for laundry, so she scrubbed the small 
blood stains on Astarion’s shirt. Because they were fresh, it was easy to 
remove them. 
As she reached down to get the next item, he was back, again with a bit of 
blood on his chest, but it was fine. She didn’t have to wash that. I mean, she 
could, but she wasn’t going to. No distractions-… for now. 
He began to do his own thing. He basically did the same thing that he did for 
the fish rack, but now it was with branches that were a little longer. And the 
rope, instead of a zig-zag pattern, it was 3 straight lines of rope.
 “What else do you need help with?,” he said already knowing it. He saw her 
little “stations” around the tent area. 
She gave him a coy smile while pointing to the log and tools with her lips 
while moving her eyebrows up.
 He looked back at her, “Seriously? Right now? But fine. Mine are better.”
 She rolled her eyes, but said nothing. They knew they both made fantastic 
arrows, but he was much faster working the wood. 
He plopped down on the ground and grabbed his tools and the log. As he did,
 he remembered the day where he was chatting with Tav. Some of the others 
had gone on a job, but Tav and Astarion had decided to stay back and “man 
the fort.” Tav, ever the practical one, and Astarion finding something to fuss 
about, were chatting, while she was making arrow shafts.
 She was busy minding her business, when a curious pale elf looking for 
something to do, came into view.
 “Oh, Taaaaav. What are you doing”
 “Making bread.”, she said as she rolled her eyes, but gave a playful laugh.
 “No wonder you’re so thin then.”
 “I need to make more arrow shafts. My recovered stash is running low. Also, 
it give me something to do. It’s a slow day.”
 “Mh. So, why don’t you simply buy more. I bet they’re cheap.”
 “Well, true. But, I don’t have that kind of coin. Well, now I do because we 
take jobs to make coin, but for years I had to make everything I owned.”
 “Interesting. Everything?”
 “Yeah, on ocassion, I would make enough coin to go to Bezentil to trade my 
wares and I’d get cloth, thread, needles. I’d make my intimates my self, 
socks, panties, bras.”
 “Oh, so you do mean everything. What you’re wearing, too?”
 “Yes. This vest is my favorite. It’s the only item I got left before the brain 
worms. I don’t know if I will ever be able to return to Lethyr. Heck perhaps if
 I did, properly my pack is gone. So, it’s what I have left of that life, I guess.”
 “You’d go back to your old life?”, he said while trying to mask his truth. 
“To be honest, no. I like this one better. The people are nice. And the 
company is better.”, she said as she saw him
 He was a bit shocked at her answer. 
What does she mean by that? The company is better? Does she mean me? I
… She probably means the whole group, or Gale.
 She saw his face of slight panic and laughed. 
“I did mean you. I like your company, Astarion.”
 “Well, who wouldn’t? I am the best company.”, he tried to play it off. 
Unsuccesful. 
“Indeed. You are to me.”, she smiled at him. 
He choked a little. He was not expecting her to beat him as his own game.
 “So, Astarion, what is your plan right now? Are you busy?”
 “Mm-… Well, I am-…” 
She cut him off. “Doing nothing. Fantastic! Grab that knife for me, will 
you?”
 “Uh, this? Here you are.”
 “So, look. With the log, you first remove the bark from it. Drift wood is 
better, because it makes a harder wood. Ash is my favorite. I mean, ash 
wood!”, she said in a final panic. 
She hated any and all jokes that could be aimed at his death in the sun or by 
fire. She disliked Minthara at times because her teasing was more like 
bullying. Tav wasn’t sure why she was so defensive about him, though. They 
were just colleauges. He ignored her panic. He took notice now and other 
times when she would do her best to incorporate him in the jobs or react to 
his dramatic banter. He liked having her as his sole audience, for she had a 
dark sense of humor and she always listened to what he had to say. 
“Ash. Noted. And what’s next? How long will the shafts be?”
 “Well, it depends on the maker, but I like to leave mine at 65 cm because I’m
 short.”
 “Indeed, you are. No ofense.”
 “None taken. It’s true. Even for my clan, I was a small kid. Still am-… I 
guess.”
 “You don’t always talk about your family. Why is that? I mean, if you don’t 
mind me asking. That is”
 “I don’t mind you asking, but I’d rather not. Would you like to learn how to 
make these? I mean, we could sell them, too and you get the profit.”
 “Mh-… tempting. But, I suppose there is nothing else to do.”
 He lied. There were a million other things he could be doing, including 
nothings, yet he was curious about her. He chose to stay and keep her 
company.
 Look at me now. Proffesing my love to that short woman and now 
I’m still making arrows for her. We never did sell any.
 He laughed more to himself at that. He knew she played him, but he was 
happy to help these days. Back then, not so much. He was different then.
 So, he had to modify the standard measurments of arrow shaft making. She 
knew she packed a punch for her size, but most would be non the wiser. He 
once saw her lick a dead spider. You don’t mess with the woman of a 
vampire spawn who also licks giant dead spiders. 
As he was reminicing about the past, his diligent hands worked masterfully in
 the present. He placed the log vertically against a rock that was half stuck in 
the ground. He saw the fish scales on a little hole, so he covered them with 
dirt. He knew her well enough that if she saw them again, she might collect 
them for “something”. He wouldn’t risk it. He took the hatchet and drove it 
along the growth rings. He split the log into 8 wedges. Then he split those 
wedges into smaller billets. For this, he instead used the serrated knife to 
make it easier. 
No wonder Tav convince him to work. His strength made this look easy. 
She’d have to put more elbow grease into it. Also, he rather not do the 
laundry; the soap dried his skin, too much. 
Then he began shaving the billets one by one. He’d check his work with each
 one. They had to be straight.
 As he worked on his own task, he went back to the conversation he had back 
then with Tav. It was the start of his relationship with her, at least as friends. 
She would always ask him the strangest questions, but he enjoyed answering 
them. It was as if she really cared about learning everything about him. 
“Astarion, do you have a preference for blood sources? I mean, apart from 
people?”
 “To be honest, you are the first person that I have taken blood from.”
 She blushed and almost dropped her knife. 
“Oh, well I hope it wasn’t bad tasting like to ‘gamey’ or something.”
 He laughed. He infact did think that. She was more wild then. She has 
softened a bit since then.
 “No, you are positively delightful, my dear Tav.”
 With a sigh of relief she said, “That’s good to know. I-… I mean… it’s just 
that-… it’s that the others always get so fidgety when your eyes start to 
change and they know you are getting hungry, and I don’t want you to have 
to go because they kick you out of the group because they are scared. I mean,
 they shouldn’t you are a perfectly good gentleman and you’ve never done 
anything else bad, apart from the time you tried to kill me on the beach or 
tried to bite me while I slept. But I mean, I understand, if you are hungry, like
 really hungry, who wouldn’t do something crazy. I mean, even animals in the
 wild will take-…”
 “Tav! Breathe!”
 She snapped out of it. She’d do this when she get nervous. Emberasingly, this
would only happen if Astarion was involved. Karlach and Lae’Zel had begun
 to notice. 
“Sorry. I just mean, if you get a bit peckish, let me know. I will make sure I 
eat good food, so I don’t taste funny.”
 “Thanks, Tav. I really appreciate that.”
 I never did correct that fact my love. Your food intake though it 
doesn’t provide me the nutrients you think, it does make it taske like the 
finest wine. But, at least I make sure you are well fed, too. 
He smiled at the knowledge and wondered if one day, the others would tell 
her that it didn’t matter if she ate liver or not.
 His work was making progress on his first three shafts, but then he asked Tav
 the  question he was very interested in. 
“Tav? So, what happened?”
 “Oh, yes! Well, when I got to the river and the Hellrider guard and the 
fisherman came in a little boat near to me, I had to start. I told them my sad 
story and I got a lot of sympathy points from the guard. I liked her. I hope 
she’s well. So, the fisherman, he wanted to sell me the buckets full of fish. I 
said, ‘No, thank you’, but he said take it or leave it. I took it. I just got them 
to accept extra work.”
 “Oh, that explains the lack of guts.”
 “Exactly. I said I was gifting them chum, so he agreed, but no scales. So, I 
had to say yes. As we were talking, I don’t remember exactly what I said, but
 it came to us needing to get to Berdusk.”
 “This is where you lied about me too, correct. Seriously, woman, of all the 
things to say-…”
 “I’m sorry. I was trying not to go into a panic. But it worked. They know you
 are pale and have red eyes. Hopefully it will minimize their nosy nature when
they finally see you.”
 “Thank you. I appreciate it.”
 “Oh, by the way, in my pack, in the bag of leather straps, I’ve still got some 
sandpaper if you need it.”
 “Great. It will make the smoothing faster and easier.”
 He got up and walked into the tent to get the little sack. He rummaged 
through her bag and took out the sack, but this felt lighter.  He opened the 
sack and didn’t see what he was expecting. 
He poured the contents on the bed of pelts to see what was inside the leather 
bag. He had just found Tav’s treasure stash, which was a random assortment 
of odd bits. He saw two pieces of parchment paper, likely Gales, but with 
very rough drawings of his own face done by Tav. These were pretty horrible
 if compared to the current one inside the book she has with her spells and 
notes. There was a pinky finger from an old leather glove. He remembered 
that. 
Gale: Will you be needing that blade, Lae’Zel?
 Lae’Zel: Keep your dirty fingers off my new sword, mage.
 Tav: Gale? Would the orb like these? 
Gale: Why yes, Tav, it would thank you. 
He said this while looking offended by Lae’Zel. She just rolled her eyes and 
walked over to Shadowheart instead. As he was distracted, Tav cut off a bit 
of the gloves. Later that day, Astarion asked why.
 “Tav, why did you cut part of the gloves for Gale.”
 She stifled a giggle while whispering her answer.
 “I wanted to know if there was a difference between a full glove versus less 
glove. He hasn’t complained, so there must be no diffence.”
 Astation laughed at that. He had forgotten that Tav thought Gale like to eat 
leather when in reality he absorved the magic embued in the item. He would 
still not correct that. The thought of Tav thinking Gale likes to eat leather 
would eventually lead her to get him a food basket with fruits and leather 
straps. He wanted to see Gale’s reaction. 
He kept looking that the things she kept. There was a folded note. He opened 
it. In horrible scribble, it said “Piss. :)” And on the back in perfect cursive, 
likely Wyll’s it just said “Why?”. Astarion just kept laughing to himself. She 
was always rather odd, especially then. This one was after Wyll failed to woo
 her. He was trying to teach her to dance. He really tried, but he was doomed. 
Wyll was too proper for such a wild little beast back then. Astarion 
remembered the conversation they had after Wyll’s fiasco. She didn’t realize 
it was flirting which made Astarion laugh harder. Wyll had game, but Tav 
didn’t know how to play. 
“So, dancing with Wyll, huh? How did you like it?”
 “Well, he’s a fantastic dancer, but I just don’t understand the moves. He tried
 really hard and I appreciate, but I got confused.”
 “I could see that.”
 “You were there? Anyway, so I tried to copy his movements, but he told me 
that I was not doing it properly. I had to do the woman’s steps. But, I don’t 
know what they are. Then he tried to show me, and I tried to copy them.”
 “Hahahaha. Wyll dancing like the lady is quite delightful.”
 “I agree. He’s an amazing dancer as the man or the woman. But, then I fell 
on my bum. I laughed. He laughed. The backpack laughed.”
 Astarion burst out laughing. Tav continued.
 “It was a mimic.”, she said as she joined Astarion’s cackle. 
Poor Wyll. He really tried. Astarion remembered when Tav was feeling 
giddy and she wrote “Piss. :)” on the parchment Gale threw away. She 
handed it to Wyll as if it were an infiltration mission. Wyll’s face was of 
strong confusion. He wrote back “Why?” and gave it back to her. Her face 
just showed disappontment. She was looking for a fun challenge and he 
didn’t get it. He was simply too proper. 
“Astarion, do you reckon Wyll is like a king or something? He’s always so 
proper that it makes me feel bad. I mean, I don’t know how to treat them. I 
asked Tara because she said she is a queen, but she only wants me to pet 
her.”
 You’ve learned so much since then, too, haven’t you Tav. From 
being almost feral to becoming our team leader. It certainly was a pleasure 
to see you grow and learn. 
He saw Lae’Zel’s sword strap which she let her keep. She knew Tav meant 
well, so she would go easy at first. Mintharas blade was here, too. Tav kept 
too much hair. There was Shadowheart’s black hair strand and a silver one, 
too. There were braids, likely Halsin’s and Jaheira’s. There was animal hair, 
too. He guessed it was from Fetch and Boo. There was even the piece of 
bandage she asked him to get from Withers. 
Astarion laughed. It made him happy that she was like this. She kept little 
mementos of the folks she considered family. She’d destroy worlds if it 
meant she’d keep them all safe. He put the things back and got another 
leather bag. That one felt too light. 
He opened it. Feathers. He laughed again. He remembered this one best. He 
was the one that did it. He was surprised she still had them.
 “If you don’t mind me asking, but what are you doing?”
 “I’m baking bread.”
 “How many do you have?”
 “I’ve gotten 3. We can eat the bird for lunch, but I will need more feathers for
 my arrows.”
“Perhaps I can help.”
 “Would you? That would be fantastic.”, she gave him the brightess smile.
 He then proceded to steal Gale’s pillow and Shadowheart’s too for good 
measure. He placed the feathers in this leather bag and tied it. Tav knew she 
should not ask where things came from when he gifted them.
 He closed the bag and set it aside. He’d be needing that. Lucky for him, third 
try’s a charm. The last bag he got was the one where the tools for making the 
arrows was. She kept tools in a wooden box, but the rest in the bag.
 “Got you.”, he told the bag.
 He finally went outside and now she was rinsing the soap from the clothes. 
“Did you find it? You took long.”
 “Yeah, I took out all other bags first.”
 “Sorry, I have to fix that bag up.”
 “Don’t worry about it. I found it.”
 “Sounds good then. And Astarion?”
 “Yes?”
 “Thank you for helping me. I really appreciate it.”
 She stopped what she was doing to go up to him. She beckoned him to bend 
down. She gave him a kiss on the cheek. 
“I love you my beautiful.”
 He smiled at her and hugged her. “I love you too, Tav.”
 She walked back to her little station and he went back to his. He continued 
his work, now smooting over with the sandpaper he found. 
“So, what happened next?”
 “I got my buckets, the salt, and the burlap over there. Then I was offered help
to cross. I paid extra, but we have to be there around 10 at night. You’ll have 
to look miserable. Yes, like that.”
 “Ha ha. Funny. So, dark glasses for that one. Go it.”
 “Then I started to collect my plants. I just got whatever I could find that 
wasn’t poisonous, but then the paladins found me.”
 “Paladins!” 
“I know. I had to be careful with them. They seemed out for blood, those 
two. But I continued to use my lie and I made them really uncomfortable. 
Told them that they might be the reason I would lose this one. Scared them 
good and proper.”, she said with a smug look.
 She continued. “So, I got them to load up the buckets and the log. I waited 
until they left for me to start moving. I had to wobble a bit. But, I dragged the
 log a bit. Then I kicked rolled it home.”
 “Ah, that explains it.”
 “Yeah, it was too heavy with all the water.”
 By now, Tav was done washing, but Astarion was still working on the shafts.
 She checked on the fish first, then went over to him to start helping. 
“You don’t have to. You should rest, Tav.”
 “Don’t worry. We’ll be cooked up when the sun is up.”
 “Very well.”
 She began to etch the notches for the feathers and heating the shafts over the 
fire. They worked in an assembly line talking about the quality of the 
materials and which piece would go best where. 
Then she let Astarion continue with the wood and she began to work on the 
arrowheads. She had at least 15 left form before, so she might not need that 
many today. Either way, it was always good to leave extras just in case.
 She took the pieces of rock and inspected what would be useful. What wasn’t
 she just threw it into the fields. She had grabbed her dagger before she even 
began washing, so she didn’t have to use the hatchet that he was using. 
With the hilt of her dagger, she made some larger rocks a little smaller. She 
grabbed her ‘favorite rock’ from her bag and used that to start shaping the 
form of the rock down to the tip. She’d check her work just like Astarion 
checked his. He kept looking at her ready to snap at her if she dared use the 
dagger’s edge to work on the rock again. She had a knife for that, but she 
forgot to grabbed that.
 She was about to. 
“I swear my dear. Don’t. Go get it.”
 She made a face and reluctantly stood up and stomped her way into the tent. 
Then stomped her was back and sat down. She made him a face.
 “I got it. See.”
 “Thank you. I’m glad you appreciate my work.”
 She smiled wide at him.
 “I always do. You have amazing fingers.”
 She covered her mouth with her hands as she realized she had made a joke 
with a double meaning. He giggled to. 
“You’re right. I do.”
 They continued their light banter talking about their day like how he felt so 
overwhelmed trapped inside the tent, and she apologizing for taking too long.
 They remembered past jobs where they did crazy things like jumping down 
to the Underdark. Tav hated that one. Or her spider licking and Gale’s shock 
and disgust. They simply worked together and laughed as the night 
progressed. By the time they noticed the night sky change, they were pretty 
much done. She ended up doing 30 arrow heads. She’d have some left over. 
As for him, he’d been able to create 30 shafts. It was more than what she was
 expecting. What with the gluing and the feathers, and all of that, she just had 
stuck some on her fingers and some on Astarion’s hair. He wasn’t too happy, 
but he sort of knew it would be like that. She kept sneezing and scratching. 
She was allergic to mixture she made for glue. He kept telling her to change 
the recipe, but she liked the final results of the one she used. 
When they least expected, they had pretty much caught up with their work. 
The clothes was now hanging to dry as was the fish. Astarion helped her 
make 30 arrows in total. He even oiled them to make them last longer. He 
had checked and mended equipment, armor, tools, and weapons. He even got 
to eat himself.
 But that was all it took. There was a loud grumble coming from her. He 
raised his eybrows as he looked at her. 
“Tav, perhaps you should eat.”
 “But it’s fish.”
 “Doesn’t matter. Food is food remember”
 “I know. I am. I will. But, could you go get more water, please. At least 
enough to wash up again.”
 “Very well. I’ll be back in no time.”
 He stood up and stretched he back. Grabbed the buckets and took off.
 “Show off.”, she said as he took off running. 
So, she went to the fish pile and got 2 of them. Removed the excess salt right 
there to not waste it. Then left them on top of the rest. She went inside and 
rummaged in his pack. She kept the bag with some spare vegetables there. 
Today was wild onion and potatoes. She took one onion and one potato. She 
grabbed her little pot and lid. She grabbed the tin with fat, too. Finally whe 
went to get her drinking waterskin. She rinsed off the veggies and the fish. 
She then checked to see if Astarion was back. He wasn’t. She used her 
dagger to cut the onion and the potatoes, but he got back right when she was 
on the second potato.
“Honestly woman, you’ve killed varmin with that blade.”
 “Well, I licked a spider, so what’s the problem?”
 “Utterly hopeless, you are.”
 “But I’m yours.”, she laughed as she pointed at him with the dagger he had 
given her. 
They sat down by the fire after Astarion finished picking up or burying the 
wood shavings. As they waited, Tav’s fish soup finished cooking and she 
finally ate. Then she washed her pot, lid, and spoon. Dried up her kitchen 
stuffs and put them away. Then they headed back in the tent. The sun would 
be up soon. 
“Thanks for the help, my beautiful. We made great progress.”
 “You’re very welcome. So, what’s next?”
 “Washing up and some rest.”
 And that’s what they did. Astarion secured the tent flaps again to keep them 
from opening accidently and they took off their dirty clothes. Tav would 
wash that in the moring. Then they headed to the side tent to clean up before 
going to sleep or trance. It would be his choice now.
