Chapter 1  
It’s over  
“That's it. It's over.”, I whispered mostly to myself as we witnessed the remaining chunks of 
the nautilus rain down from the blue, almost orange looking sky. I was glad this was done 
because my limbs were about to scream in agony. We hadn’t had a proper rest for weeks at 
this point. As I looked over my companions, my smile couldn’t be contained. We survived, 
despite it all, we survived. I listened to what each had to say, keeping my thoughts to myself, 
but then I felt a chill run down my spine. As I looked over, I was horrified as realization hit 
me like ice-water, Astarion. 
Looking as dashing as every despite it all, I focused my attention on him. “So, what’s next for 
us? The world is our oyster, and she has many pearls we can choose from.”, he laughed. 
I hoped that my ill feeling was wrong, but we’d gotten lucky enough and it was running dry. 
“I honestly don’t mind what we do, once we get… Ow!” he exclaimed. 
In horror, we began to see smoke coming from under his armor. His perfect pale face started 
to show patches where flames would soon burst if he didn’t get out of the sunlight fast. 
“What the - oh no. Oh, gods. Well… it was nice while it lasted. Argh! I’m sorry, I- I have to 
go!”, Astarion said painfully and took off running. 
I was too shocked to move as I glanced over the others, but when Shadoheart spoke, I was 
incredulous! That’s all you guys have?! We have done so much for each other… Astarion, my 
heart split into a million needles as he took off running in pain, all the while the group, our 
friends, had not so much to say as an “Oh, well. Sucks to suck.” I can’t leave him alone like 
this. 
“It seems that’s the end of Astarion’s love affair with the sun. That’ll be hard on him…” said 
Shadoheart. 
He’s close to death and that’s all you’ve got to say! I dared not stay any longer among them 
and listen to their “poor him, oh well” commentary. I took off running after him, forcing my 
aching limbs to pull strength from the ether, for I had nothing left in me after the fight. He 
was in danger, my Astarion was in danger… What? I mean, my friend needs me. 
As I thought that, my body moved faster, I could see the outline of him darting in whichever 
shadow he could find in a panic. Seeing a giant tarp-like material nearby some barrels and a 
fallen wall, I grabbed it as tight as I could while I sped up. Dodging the random survivor here
 and there or jumping over crates and barrels, I had to push harder to reach him in time. 
” I’ve got you!” I said more to myself than to him, but he looked up at my right before I 
covered him with the thick tarp and pushed him under a sort of wheeled cart. His eyes were 
shocked yet scared for he almost died. He had survived to become a hero, and that was to be 
his end? Not if I could help it. 
“ Tav! …what?…how?… I…”, he stammered, too shocked to speak. “ Are you hurt, 
Astarion?! Do you need medical help?! How can I help?! Please, tell me! What should I do?!” I
 said as I began to feel tears fall down my cheek. Why was I so terrified for his safety? Sure, 
we had our bit of fun here and there, but why did it hurt to see him like this, so weak? Could 
it be…? No, I surely can’t be, can I? 
“Tav, I- I am alright, I think. You arrived just in the nick of time. It’s just that my hair… well, 
thank you.” He tried to fake a smile, but his eyes betrayed him. He was grateful that at least 
one of the gang came after him in his time of need. Likewise, he wasn’t expecting anyone to 
try to save a vampire-spawn from bursting into flames. 
“I don’t want to remove the tarp just yet. I am afraid that if I do, you will start burning again. 
So, you better get comfortable because I am not moving and neither are you.” I said to what I 
think was his ear. 
I couldn’t tell, for I threw the tarp on him, pushed him down and under. I hadn’t been that 
close to him since the time in the woods when we… the memory of him waking me up as he 
tried to sneak a bite while I slept, then the memory of him inviting him for a bit of fun in the 
woods. My body began to flush, my heart started to race at the memory of him. I have to 
focus. I don’t have time for my fantasies and raunchy memories of him. He is my friend and I 
want him to be safe, especially now that he no longer has sun-protection. 
“Well, I don’t suppose you will be moving off me anytime soon, my dear?” he asked in a 
more relaxed tone. I shifted a little, but I didn’t want to move, I was too scared. What if I 
move a little and he loses a foot. I can’t risk it. 
“Do you want me to move? I don’t think it’s safe, yet. Do you think you can wait until the sun
 fully sets?” I asked while trying to sound calm and nonchalant. I doubt he bought it. He was 
the expert at lying, and I tended to be too honest and straightforward. He giggled and shifted 
to get a little more comfortable. After all, I was technically the big spoon at the moment… 
well, as big a spoon as I could be with my height and frame. 
“On second thought, I don’t mind this. It’s not every day that our hero Tav offers her, should 
I say, services in this way. I think I am going to enjoy this a little longer.” I tried to kick him 
for saying that, but it was a tight space and I ended up getting closer to his back. I felt him 
stifle a laugh. 
“You’re lucky I don’t want to see my mates in danger, Astarion. Stop teasing, or I will kick 
your calf once we get out.” I said, but I couldn’t say it with anger. 
“Oh, so mates, are we? And here I thought I was losing to Gale? Hahaha” 
“What?! Gale? I mean, he is a great guy and all, but I… never mind that.” 
My cheeks flushed red, I could feel it. Astarion always knew how to ruffle my feathers in a 
good way. 
“I’m only joking, my sweet. We are in a bit of a tough spot. I simply wanted to make light of 
it. But still, mates…” 
“Well, let me rephrase it then, I don’t want to see my friends in danger, that includes you. 
How about that?” 
“No, I think I will keep ‘mates’ intact, even if you do mind.” He laughed as he cradled 
himself better. 
Neither of us spoke for a while, so I closed my eyes as we waited for the sun to fully set. It 
would be a matter of minutes now. 
“Are you sleeping, Tav?” he asked almost as a whisper. 
“Mmh… no.”, I mumbled half asleep now. I used up all and any energy I had. 
He sighed. 
“Thank you for coming to my aid. That means a lot.” 
“I don’t want to lose you.” I whispered, half asleep. I was too tired to mind my words, but 
perhaps he didn’t really hear me. 
“I don’t want to lose you either, love.” He whispered back. 
I must have fallen asleep because I woke with a shock when I heard a male’s voice shout my 
name. 
“Tav! Where are you? Did you find Astarion? Where could those two have gone?!” It was 
Wyll. His voice startled me back awake. “Over here! Under the cart. Help us up, will you.” I 
shouted. 
“It’s fine now, Astarion. The sun has set. It’s dark out. I’m removing the tarp from you. You’ll
 be safe, I promise.” I whispered to him, my heart feeling calmer now that I knew he would 
survive another day or, better yet, another night. “Sounds like a plan. Thank you for staying 
until it got safe, Tav.” 
I wiggled my way out from under the cart while taking the tarp with me and revealing 
Astarion, who was now safe and complete. No embers, no fires, no nothing, just his perfect 
elf-self. He also shimmied himself out and Wyll helped him up. 
“We got so caught up in the celebration that I didn’t react as I should have. I’m sorry, 
Astarion. I should have reacted better and come to your aid.” Wyll apologized not looking 
Astarion in the eyes. He sure seemed ashamed, and he should. He should have known better. 
I wasn’t too happy with any of them right now, but my anger would dissipate soon enough. 
I’m just glad it’s dark out and we are okay. 
“Don’t mention it. I wasn’t alone after all. Tav came to my rescue and stayed with me. She 
even took a nap of all things, that woman.” Astarion teased. My cheeks flushed yet again. He 
saw and gave me a mischievous grin. I couldn’t help myself and smiled back. “I’m just glad 
you lot are safe now.” I managed to say. 
So, where is the rest of the group? Is Karlach…?” 
“She’s as fine as she can be. I was asked to try to find you and take you back to where the rest 
are. We are about to leave. She won’t last much longer here.” 
“Oh, dear. Then we must hurry back. Come on! Which way?!” 
“Yes, it’s in this direction in the little tavern we saw near the water.” 
“Come on, Astarion. Let’s go. I want Gale to check you before you try to take off again.” 
“Yes, yes, I’m coming.” 
The ruined city, all these people… we need to see how we can help them rebuild or 
something, but first Karlach. “Karlach! I’m here!” She looks up and smiles, flashing her pearly
 whites from ear to ear. 
“Hey, soldier. I almost thought you wouldn’t make it. I see Astarion is still with us. I’m glad. I
 think the one going will be me.” She tried to laugh while clutching where her heart should be.
 “What do we do now, sweetie?” I asked while moving closer to touch her. “ I think nothing. 
It’s time for me to go.” Wyll also moved closer and put his hand over hers. 
“Don’t say that, Karlach. You can go back to the hells. I am certain once there, your engine 
will stabilize.” 
“The thing is that I don’t want to go back, soldier. My home is here with my new friends. My 
family.” 
“What if I go with you? We can fight together. We can find a cure together. You don’t have to 
do it alone.” 
“What? Are… are you sure? It’s not an easy place to be. I cannot ask this of you, of anyone.” 
“Well, that settles it then. We’re going back to the hells. I’m not asking your permission, 
either. I am telling you. Let’s go.” 
“Wow, soldier…Wyll. I never imagined you would sound this tough. It’s sexy. Hahaha. Let’s 
go then. Friends, I love you so much. I will be back once I get this thing under control. Don’t 
be strangers, will ya? Take care of each other.” 
And just like that, we were down 2 members all too soon. Although sad, I know I will see 
them again soon enough. We just have to find a way to help Karlach, too. I am starting to 
think that we bit off more than we can chew on this. 
Gale, looking his best already with a smart tunic and I think also bathed… so soon, too, takes 
over the room. “… So, I say let’s celebrate! Let’s eat and drink and relax. We’ve all earned it.” 
Folks cheered all around us, but my eyes felt heavy and my body ached.
