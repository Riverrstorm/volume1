Chapter 5 – Blessings shared 
As Petras joined River greeted him. She had something in her hand. 
River: “Petras, can you hold out your hand, please?”
 Petras: “Why? What for?” 
He was still unsure about her after yesterday’s show of her skill. 
River: “Because I’ve got something to give you. A gift. A title. Your given 
right. And because I love you that’s why. Hold out your fucken hand. I’m not 
going to bite you-… I’ll bit him, but you’ll be fine. Give your hand.”
 Reluctantly he did show his hand. Then she aked Dal to give her hand too. 
River placed a piece of blessed moonstone in their hand. They felt the energy 
it gave off, yet they weren’t hurt by it. 
River: “You know what that is?”
 Dr. Dalyria: “Is this moonstone? A fragment-… a blessed fragment?”
 River: “Yes, that it is. I found it in the temple. I took it. I placed it in the light 
of Selune.”
 Petras: “Why doesn’t it hurt us? It should burn us at least?”
 River: “For the same reason Astarion doesn’t get hurt when he feeds on me. 
You are protected from what would normally hurt you. This blessing is not 
given lightly, though. Our love is conditional. You play nice, you gain the 
blessing. You return to the teaching of the demon that trapped you, that rock 
will poison you. Those statues will destroy you. I will have to kill you. I will 
destroy Faerun and rebuid it to make space for you, as long as you play your 
part. Decide to become Cazador’s memory of chaos, I will do to you what 
was done to him. It’s not a threat. It’s my gift to you.”
 Astarion: “I know that it sounds like a threat, but it is in a way. You have a 
choice now, but the consequences for your own choices will be devastating to
 all of us.”
 River: “Also, that rock is your direct link back to me. Your champion in this 
darkness. If you decide to set up your one settlement, not that I am kicking 
you out, but if you do want to have a little spot, plant it. It’s your cornerstone 
to allow our blessing to where you are, wherever that may be.”
Dal analysed the rock. She was interested on why it wasn’t hurting them. She
 could tell that the rock radiated some light, and understood it was likely from 
what would be radiant light. As for Petras, he was on another idea 
completely. His mind wandered.
 So this rock protects us? I wonder if I go and explore, what sort of things it
 would do. Or maybe just keeps us safe from the statues she said. She’s very 
intense, though. I wonder why Astarion stays. Maybe that’s why. She 
wouldn’t let him. Hahaha. Good. He deserves a new master that’s meaner 
than Cazador. Let’s focus, Petras. Today, I want to out and explore the 
north side. I’m going to tell them. Don’t want that woman to be chasing 
after me. She’s a little scary. 
Petras was just off in his own little world for a bit. Then he spoke up.
 Petras: “I want to go explore the north side of this outpost. You say the 
statues won’t hurt us, so I want to go and see what’s around. Besides, you 
guys say you want to build spaces, right. Perhaps I find a good spot or 
materials. Also, I want to check out the information from the book first 
hand.”
 Dr. Dalyria: “Petras, are you sure. It can be dangerous to go alone. Perhaps, I 
can go with you?”
 Petras: “No, Dal. I saw you carry books to your room. It’s been too long since
 you got to do what you want. You can stay. Besides, I’ll be careful. They say 
the rock will keep me safe.”
 Astarion: “That’s not what we said, but if you want to meet your fate, go. I 
won’t stop you.”
 River: “Listen, the protection is more about the moon artillery not targeting 
you and shooting at you. But, I won’t stop you from leaving, either. You are 
free to go and return as you would like. But, please do be careful. I still don’t 
have a way to contact you or you to contact us in case you need help. Just 
stay safe. If you are overwhelmed, don’t be a hero. Run. Come back. We can 
go and help you finish what you need later.”
 Petras: “Fine, mom. I’ll be careful.”
Astarion just rolled his eyes in annoyance and River was just confused while 
Dalyria laughed to herself. Petras got up, placed the rock in his pocked, and 
left. He climbed over the tower on the right which was broken, so it was an 
easy climb down.
 Then he took a deep breath and walked down the stairs, hoping they were 
right about the defense mechanism. But, nothing activated. The statues did 
make a single sound. So, he kept going forward. 
The rest that stayed behind just looke at each other. Dal was a little worried 
for she knew Petras struggled with self-control. She remembered when he 
wanted to get another victim for himself after Cazador’s ritual. But, he was 
right about her. She did want to stay at the outpost and do what she wanted. 
And what she wanted was to check out the books. That morning the new 
batch of books had arrived and she had placed them on the table. Since there 
were two, one was mainly used as a work table while the other was for eating
 and chatting.
 So, she just wanted to read for a bit. 
Dr. Dalyria: “Well, I think I will go to my room and read. I got some of the 
books that were here before and new ones arrived. I’d like to see what’s in 
them, if you don’t mind.”
 River: “Of course. Go ahead. Anything else you need, just let me know. I’ll 
just eat something and I’ll head to the Grove. And Doctor, thank you for 
staying.”
 She just nodded and smiled then left to her room. Astarion sat down in front 
of River this time and took her hand.
 Astarion: “Well, mom, it seems your boy might be less reluctant today. 
Hahaha.”
 River: “Shut up. That makes you the dad, then. But I am worried that he gets 
overwhelmed by more than 5 whatevers while exploring alone. I know he can
 take one-on-one with ease, but what if he lands in a place with a lot? I’m not 
happy about him going alone, but it can’t be helped.”
Astarion: “Gods, woman! You make it so difficult to tease you. You’re no 
fun.”
 River: “Well, ha ha. So anyway, how are you doing? Hungry? Remember to 
let me know if you need to feed.”
 He looked down at her hands in his. He hated having to do it sometimes, but 
her blood did clear his mind and it had been a few days since he last drank. 
Seeing that, she stood up and walked around the table to stand next to him.
 River: “Get up. Come on.”
 He stood up and faced her. She moved her neck to allow him a better hold 
then placed her hands on his hips. He kissed her forehead then leaned in to 
bite. As he was doing so, Dalyria happened to be walking back to the kitchen 
and was shocked at what she saw. She had a bit of a panic.
 Oh, dear! I should have not come. Do I go back slowly? Oh, this is not for 
me to see.
 She simple closed her eyes and waited until they finished. River hadn’t 
noticed her for she too closed her eyes. Though he had but was busy so he 
wasn’t going to stop just because he had an audience. 
He got his fill and let go. He licked his lips and her neck. Then stood up 
straight and finally addressed Dalyria. 
Astarion: “You can open your eyes now, Dal. I’m done.”
 River: “Oh, I’m sorry. I didn’t think you’d come back. Next time, I’ll make 
sure it’s in our room. Sorry, Doc.”
 Dr. Dalyria: “It is I who should apologize. I didn’t want to intrude, I was just 
coming back to give you an added list. I found it on the floor. Petras dropped 
it.”
 River took it and smiled. 
River: “That’s fantastic. Like this I don’t have to do extra trips. I’ll try my 
best to collect these items. And again, sorry. Not my intention to make you 
uncomfortable.”
 Dr. Dalyria: “No, it’s fine. I’m sorry, too. You both deserve to have your 
privacy in your home.”
 Astarion: “It’s your home too, dear. But like River said, well be mindful of 
where we do our private matters.”
 Dal nodded and took her leave. River had already begun eating. It was going 
to be along day it seemed. So, she had to get a move on. Astarion would stay 
behind to check out some books, too. He wasn’t too thrilled about the 
construction ones, but it was always good to expand his knowledge. 
River got ready to head out, weapons and all. The cart was ready by the 
portal, too. Her little Helen Wheels still was holding up quite well despite the
 labor she did. Then River kissed him before she left.
 River: “Brush your teeth. You taste metallic.”
 Astarion: “Yes, mom. Be careful out there. Come back in one piece.”
 River: “Will do my love. And be nice. Love you.”
 And like that she was off. He’d given her 100 gold to spend. They both 
thought it was more than enough for what was needed. Today’s haul was 
going to be for everyone. 
Astarion took some books and went to the bedroom, but as he was heading 
that way, Dalyria stopped him. She needed to talk. She wanted to know. She 
was curious and couldn’t help it. Their dynamic wasn’t common. River 
wasn’t common. 
Dr. Dalyria: “Astarion, sorry but, can we talk?”
 Astarion: “Regarding?”
 She avoided his eyes and looked at the floor. She was emarassed to even 
bring it up, but her scientific mind was returning to her after so long. She 
wanted to know.
Dr. Dalyria: “About her. How long have you been feeding of her?”
 He wasn’t considering that the conversation would be about this, so he 
decided to sit and put the books down instead. The light coming from the 
braziers flickered dancing shadows in the room, but with the new decorations
 like the rugs and chairs and even the table, it made it look less like an 
abandoned outpost, and more like a little study or living room. He beckoned 
her to have a seat also. 
Astarion: “By now, about a year. Like we said before, she offered herself to 
keep my aid. She hasn’t stopped.”
 Dr. Dalyria: “So, you’ve never used your charm to get her to let you? I mean,
 what we had to do before to lure victims for-…”
 Astarion: “Believe me. I tried. But all my tricks fell flat. Back then she 
wasn’t as eloquent, I suppose. She trully was feral. She’d grown up in 
solitude in the forest. She was very young, though smart. But, take away a 
child from society and animals will finish rearing what people didn’t. She 
understood animal behavior. Even now that’s her default.”
 Dr. Dalyria: “What do you mean? So, this is about her being banished from 
her home. That’s truly fascinating. I mean, I just feel there is this certain edge
 to her. I like her, but I feel like she’s not-…”
 Astarion: “Human-like. Yeah, I agree. She’s gotten better at hiding it. I know 
she feels inadequate when she compares herself to me. Would you believe 
she sees me as some sort of royal prince or at least she still thinks I’m a high 
born magistrate. Mad woman that one.”
 Dr. Dalyria: “It must be because of how she had to deal with in her crucial 
years of development. But the way she looks at you. She adores you. I’ve 
never seen that kind of-… love and devotion ever. You are very lucky to have
 found someone like her. Especially because our kind don’t get to have a good
 ending.”
 Astarion: “I am very blessed. She has chosen to stay with me not because I 
compelled her to stay, but because she chooses to be with me. To be honest, I 
am a little afraid about that. If I were to get hurt and not survive, she has told 
me that she will go, too. In her mind, it’s not worth living. She doesn’t care 
about life if she can’t share it with me. Who in their right mind says that?”
Dr. Dalyria: “Oh, that does make it more-… fascinating. I mean, I have been 
observing you both. You move like shadows of each other. You move a little 
and she accomodates. She does the same and you do it, too. It’s like you are 
one mind in two bodies. Could it be because you have fed from her for so 
long? Has she shown any signs of change? And what about you? Have you 
shown any signs of change?”
 He laughed a little. He was glad Dal was recovering her true self and felt safe
 enough to do so, but he was a little peeved that he was her first true target. He
 figured it was because River was gone at the moment. He also knew that 
even if he refused to answer now, River would just pour out everything 
anyway, so he might as well relent and let Dal have the answers she wanted. 
What damage could it cause?
 This daring sister of mine. She wants to know everything. I’ll draw the line 
somewhere, but her audacity. Honestly, if I didn’t know that once she grabs
 River and get all she wants out of her, I wouldn’t even consider answering 
now. These two are going to drive me insane. River already loves Dal and 
Dal is falling in love with the mad one. Gods help me with these two and 
Petras.
 Astarion: “Fine. It’s not like River would keep secrets anyway and I know 
you’ll corner her too. Let’s see, I have noticed that we move like one. She 
says we are “a well-oiled war-machine”. We have fought along each other for
 a while, so we understand each other. We even complement our fighting 
styles. She’s ranged and moves swiftly. She takes some down or weakens 
them. At times, she’s the decoy. I swop in and deliver the killing blow. But 
she can also do melee. I try to limit that, though.”
 Dr. Dalyria: “You don’t want her to get hurt. That’s reasonable, she is alive 
and well, a little on the smaller side.”
 Astarion: “Well, not entirely that. The thing is that she was trained to be 
vicious. A killer from a young age. Her first kill left its scars. It was a cousin 
she took care of before being forced to kill him. Rikkon was his name. A 
rather weak boy. So, when she does close combat, she leaves her mind. It’s 
like another takes over and becomes very wild, feral. Like an animal. Her 
eyes, her common sparkle disappears and she looks like us. The longer she 
stays in that state, the harder it is for me to bring her back. So, if I can, I try to
 not let her do close combat. I don’t know exactly why it still happens, but it is
 useful. And I hate to admit it. That other one that takes over is very useful 
during battle. She barks out orders with precision and if we follow them, we 
win. They did a number on her and she knows it. It terrifies her to get lost 
and not be able to come back-… to me.”
 Dr. Dalyria: “That’s horrible. No wonder she groups herself with us. Why 
else would anyone want to? Perhaps she has a different kind of bloodlust.”
 Astarion: “As for change, I’m not sure it there is. But, I don’t know. By now, 
to be honest, she forces me to drink instead of the other way around. Last 
time I drank was before you guys appeared. That was two days ago. She 
doesn’t let it go past three days. I don’t always want to, but she is persistant. 
Also, she doesn’t want me to drink from any other person that isn’t her. She 
is just as possessive if not more than me.”
 Dr. Dalyria: “Perhaps I can help you both find out how her body is taking this
 long term symbiosis. Who knows, it could be both a benefit and a hindrance 
to her body.”
 Astarion: “You know what? I think that is a fantastic idea. Also, I’d like to 
ask you for a favor, well if you can. When I met her, she had a mark on her 
abdomen, a little under her navel on the right. If she touched it, it burned her, 
she said. I’m guessing it burned where her womb is. If I did it, she felt just 
my cold hand. But-… after our-… wedding, should I say ceremony, after I 
finished-… we-… After we had sex at the feet of the statue, some time after a
 demi-goddess, Dame Aylin, Selune’s daughter, came. She just appeared out 
of nowhere and did something to her. It seems like she burned off the magical
 branding River had.”
 Dr. Dalyria: “What do you think the branding did to her before?”
 Astarion: “We believe it kept her baren. She told me she hadn’t  bled since 
she was branded. Her mother when she realized that River was finally 
bleeding, she was banished from her home. She hasn’t bled since. But, now 
we don’t know. She hasn’t bled, but the scar is gone.”
 Dr. Dalyria: “Are you afraid she might get pregnant? Astarion, we’re spawn, 
I don’t think you could, but then again-…”
 Astarion: “Then again what, Dal? What are you thinking?”
 Dr. Dalyria: “Well, from what I know from my years studying us, there is a 
small possibility for a vampire to impregnate a living female. It’s very rare 
and it is usually a death sentence to the female. I mean, if she was pregnant 
first and then bitten, the child would be born undead. This same child would 
kill the mother if somehow she survived the feeding. But there is some 
information regarding something far less common.”
 Astarion: “WHAT?! What do you mean?”
 Dr. Dalyria: “What I mean is there is some very obscure information about 
vampires creating a hybrid. A mix of living and undead. But, as spawn, I 
don’t know it that is even a risk for you both. What else can you tell me? 
Have you had any changes in your body since you began feeding?
 Astarion: “Well, I think yes. But I don’t know if it’s because I am feeding 
more frequently now or because of her. Could be both. The biggest change 
I’ve had is-… well-… I’m sorry, but talking about this is embarrasing.”
 Dr. Dalyria: “You don’t have to share, but the more you do, the easier we can 
find answers or at least try to get them.”
 Astarion: “Fine. When I make love to her-… I can reach climax. In 200 
years, I was forced to prostitute myself, as you know. But, I felt nothing. It 
was something we did. The victims would reach completion. And this was 
the case when I first slept with her. But, then I kept doing it. I didn’t have to, 
but I did. I was conflicted. And she kept herself for me. She had other 
potential suitors, but she only allowed me to have her. After we defeated the 
netherbrain and the battle was won, things changed.”
 Dr. Dalyria: “In what way? What’s different now?”
 He stood up and started pacing around the room. He was conflicted. This 
information was his, it was private. But if he kept it to himself, it could lead 
to something that could put her in danger. He had to put his guard down at 
least for now. He stopped pacing and looked directly at his sister.
 Astarion: “In the tavern, before we started our journey here, we talked-… 
about us. I was undecided about how I felt about her, about this. She had 
already told me that she would follow me and stay with me because we were 
friends. And I really pushed that. I pretended to be her friend and she played 
along. Of course she would. She was astute and used my own scheems 
against me. I was such a fool.”
His demeanor was changing as his common arrogance and nonchalant attitue 
was finally crumbling. 
Astarion: “I used her for protection, but she was always true to me. Then 
Halsin cornered me and told me the truth I dind’t want to hear. I was 
throwing her bread crumbs while also using her for release. I was a monster 
to her, but she saw right through me. She chose me despite everything. But, 
her patience was wearing thin.”
 Dalyria saw him with concern. She’d never seen him in pain like this. This 
was not the Astarion she knew. This was a man distraught by his actions. This
 man felt pain and felt love. He showed that he cared about the woman and he 
was still not able to forgive himself for using the sins of his past to use her.
 Astarion: “She confronted me and told me to really think about what I 
wanted. She was tired of pretending to be just a friend while secretly 
yearning for my touch and affection. And I couldn’t-… I felt wrong, tainted. 
And then she gave me the ultimatum. Friends don’t just casually have sex. 
She called me out. Hahaha. Can you believe that? There I was, thinking that I
 had power over her and instead she had it over me.”
 He sat down, defeated. 
Astarion: “She asked me to choose what I was looking for. She would follow 
me to hell and back regardless, but she needed to know what she was to me. 
My resolve broke. I made love to her that day. And it felt amazing, like never 
before. I felt how energy coursed through my body. She made me feel alive. 
Every caress, every kiss. I felt like lightning had entered my body as I was 
deep inside her. I felt every wave of her orgasms deep inside me. And that’s 
what changed.”
 Dal was a little uncomfortable hearing this because it was her brother, but 
intrigued as a doctor. She too had suffered Cazador’s command, so she 
understood what he meant, but to a point. She never felt electric. Astarion 
was intimate because he wanted to be and with a person who clearly had 
affection towards him. Perhaps that is what made the difference.
Astarion: “As I allowd my body to enjoy hers, I began to feel a pain in me. It 
began in the stomach, a little below the navel. My muscles began to contract 
a little. My hips had a mind of their own. Then she beckoned me to feed on 
her. I couldn’t stop myself. My body leaned in as my hips kept moving on 
their own and then I bit down. As her blood ran down my throat, I felt how 
she climaxed harder that time. But as she did, I felt it inside me. Like a fire or
 a burning sensation. I had no control of my body then. But, it didn’t last long 
either. I felt how from inside me, I climaxed.”
 He looked up and with a worried expression, he finished his retelling of that 
night.
 Astarion: “I felt it come from me and she told me that it burned a little at 
first. I ran down her. I filled her up and it ran down. How? In 200 years, I’ve 
never ejaculated. Never! I’ve had thousands of partners. And this one, I had 
her dozens of times and never once. But that night-…”
 Dr. Dalyria was shocked and intrigued. Her mind was racing. She was trying 
to make connections with the little information she had, but this would need 
time to disect. In other words, Astarion was right. This wasn’t supposed to 
happen, but it did.
 Dr. Dalyria: “And since then, every time you are intimate, you continue to-…
 ejaculate inside her?”
 Astarion: “Yes. Every time I climax, there is something there. She has not 
told me it causes any discomfort since. But the only time I feel that sensation 
is when I am making love to her. Outside of that, my body remains in a 
vampiric state. I don’t know what to make of it still.”
 Dr. Dalyria: “That is-… I also don’t know what to make of it. Like I said, 
there isn’t much information about this. At the palace, I only found 2 books 
which had some information from different centuries regarding what I said. 
Someting about vampire lords creating armies of spawn, but then somehow 
they experimented and found that full vampires could get living females 
pregnant. But it wasn’t something that was common even then.”
Despite his better judment, he asked her the question he really wanted to 
know.
 Astarion: “How?”
 He tried to not sound too interested to avoid her suspicion. It worked.
 Dr. Dalyria: “Well, I remember it said that the vampire must overfeed. They 
would have to gorge themselves with blood. This would temporarily return 
some life and life functions to the vampire. Then they would have to have sex
 with a female. My theory is that doing this, reactivated their living functions 
down to being able to create the sperm needed. So, they would have to 
ejaculate inside the woman and she’d become pregnant. There was even a 
side note that these vampires who were over-fed actually had a bit of a pink 
tone to their skin. That being from an excess of blood.”
 Then, as Dalyria made the connection, she covered her mouth in shock. She 
realized he got the answer he wanted. She looked at him. The coy smile he 
gave her unnerved her. A worried thought came to her.
 Dalyria, you fool! What have you done?! Is he mad enough to try? Has 
this new life where he is regaining his life back made him believe this is 
possible? But, what if he puts her in danger. The books said the women 
didn’t’ survive, but-… perhaps he’s confident that she’s been feeding him 
and in return he’s making her more resistant to us? Oh, dear. This gives 
me a bad feeling.
 Dr. Dalyria: “Astarion, you can’t surely believe my words. They were old 
books. At this point it is just speculation from unverified accounts. Surely this
 is just coincidence that you can even-…”
 Astarion: “For the longest time, I’ve blamed myself for taking away her 
chance at having a family. If there can be even a small chance of giving her 
that, I will take it. I know she wants it. She’s told me that much, but it has to 
be me. She won’t with anyone else. I just need to see if she can handle it. The
 book said the vampires went and got those women pregnant. But what if 
that’s the difference? River has been feeding me for a long time. Perhaps her 
body is taking on some of my traits. Perhaps she’s stronger than any human 
woman. She’s a wood-elf-… and also part human, but-… she’s got Selune’s 
blessing, too. Maybe everything is falling into place. I could give her the 
child she wants. I mean, she sees you all as her own. She calls you ‘her 
babes’ when we’re alone. Doesn’t that mean anything?!”
 Dr. Dalyria: “I think you need to calm down first. Second, I think that all that 
you are saying is very valid, especially if it is something she has told you she 
wants. Perhaps, I can use my knowledge in medicine and beging to-…”
 Astarion: “She’s not an experiment to be studied!”
 Dr. Dalyria: “No, she’s not. But I do believe she’s first in her kind or case. 
When have you heard of a woman who willingly feeds a vampire or even a 
spawn without being coerced? For longer than a year, no less. When have 
you heard of a Selunite champion vow her sword to protect people like us? 
She is passing on the blessing to us. We should not be able to stand here like 
it’s any old place, Astarion! This is a consecrated land. It’s a blessed land. 
You and I both know we shouldn’t be able to touch the stones and here we 
are like it’s nothing special. She’s special. She’s doing so much because I 
believe, she wants to do it. Her love for you is so deep and so vast that it has 
extended to us. I would dare say she already loves Petras and I and we didn’t 
meet in the best of ways. If I can use my knowledge to keep her safe I will. 
But, I also want to help you. But, you have to be smart about your actions, or 
she can get hurt.”
 Astarion: “ I know. You’re right. It’s just-… I don’t want her to feel like she’s
 my or our experiment. I don’t want to hurt her either.”
 Dr. Dalyria: “I understand. I want to keep her safe. But, I think we should 
start building her medical history, just so we have a better chance at helping 
her if things go wrong. But especially if you suceed in your quest of 
becoming a father.”
 The smile that placed on Astarion was wide. Even his eyes gave a sparkle. He
 never thought that was something he wanted if given the chance, but with her
 it was as natural as living. He wanted it. He didn’t know before, but if there 
was a slight chance, he wanted it with all his being. He wanted for her to 
carry his child if they had the blessing to do so. 
Dalyria, decided to let him simmer in his thoughts and left for her room. 
During that time, unbeknown to River of that conversation, she was walking 
under the bright daylight. Her eyes feeling some pins and needles as she tried
 to adjust her eyes to the brightness. It had been some time since she’d been 
out.
 Oh, this is not good. My eyes are going to be better suited to the dark rather
 than the light. I guess, I’ll just have to walk to the grove with my eyes 
closed for today or see if I can find some dark glasses. 
So, she kept walking with her eyes closed until she got to the Grove’s gate. 
River: “Hey! Open up please. I got some shopping to do.”
 The guards, recognizing who it was, opened up just enough to let her 
through. She thank them and kept going. Zevlor noticed she was walking 
with her eyes closed. 
Zevlor: “Tav! What’s wrong? Why are you walking with your eyes closed?”
 River: “The sunlight is hurting them. I think because down there has 
weakened them. I don’t know. But I open them a little if needed.”
 She smiled at him, but he wasn’t too confident. 
Zevlor: “Perhaps you should have Nettie look at them. She might be able to 
give you something.”
 River: “I hate it when people tell me truths I don’t want to hear. Fine, can you
 help me there, please?”
 She laughed while reluctantly following. She knew he was right, but she was 
stubborn, not stupid.
 Zevlor: “Nettie, dear. Have you got a moment? I’ve brought someone who 
needs your help.”
 Nettie: “And who might that be?”
 River: “Hello beautiful. Long time no see.”
River thought that was hilarious. She loves puns, like I said before.
 Nettie: “Tav! And what brings you-… never mind. Zevlor, help her have a 
seat. Well, let’s see. What seems to be the problem?”
 River opened her eyes but winced a little before finally opening them fully. 
But it was clear that her eyes were a little too watery.
 River: “Well, I have been going up and down all this time. But today when I 
got out here, I felt a sort of burning sensation on my eyes. I didn’t feel that 
yesterday. So, I just figured I’d come here with my eyes closed. They sort of 
feel like when wind blows sand in your eyes or something like that. I’ve 
never had this before.”
 Nettie: “Let me have a look. Zevlor, hold this lamp for me close to her face. 
Thanks.”
 Nettie took out a little mirror to direct the light into River’s eyes. She winced.
 River: “Wow, that hurt. Why would that be? Light has never hurt before. Do 
you think living down there has weakened my eyes?”
 Nettie: “That or your body is changing. Tav? How long have you been letting 
Astarion feed on you?”
 River averted her gaze but her flushed cheeks gave her the answer. 
Nettie: “That long. Mmm-… and I suppose you have been intimate with each
 other for the same amount of time?”
 Now, it was Zevlor who was blushing, which was hard to notice because he 
was already very red. 
Nettie: “Well, your silence speaks volumes. Tav, I’m no expert, but I can 
make a speculation that perhaps you are actively experiencing an adaptation. 
I mean, perhaps your body is adapting to the Underdark, but with the help of 
his saliva and perhaps other fluids, your body is adjusting. You don’t smell 
like them entirely, but there is a faint trace of him in you. Your skin in 
particular. Perhaps your eyes are getting light sensitive as a combination of 
factors. But perhaps this can help. I use it when, as you said, I get dust in my 
eyes. It just flushes out the eyes and gives some relief.”
 She handed her a little vial with a yellowish liquid. 
Nettie: “It’s basically a chamomille tincture. It flushes out the dust if any and 
it relaxes the muscles. I’m sure it can bring some relief.”
 River placed a drop of liquid in each eye and she did feel better. 
River: “Oh that feels nice. Hi Zevlor! Long time no see.”
 He just rolled his eyes as he smiled. She always put him in a good mood.
 River: “So, how much to I owe you, love?”
 Nettie: “Right now, no coin. But later a favor.”
 River: “Sounds good to me. I’m good with those. Well, I’ll get out of your 
way. And thank you so much.” 
Nettie: “Don’t mention it. See you around.”
 They headed back out in awkward silence. 
River: “Well, then so much for keeping secrets, right? Listen, back there, it 
was uncomfortable for both of us. But, I hope you don’t have to blush every 
time we speak. I mean, Astarion and I are both adults and all that.”
 Zevlor: “Tav. I get it. You don’t have to explain anything. But, you must 
admit it was embarrasing to have someone read you like that.”
 River: “That it was. I mean, when Astarion told me that even Halsin saw us 
here back at the party I-…” 
Zevlor: “Tav! Please!”
 She cackled. He was more embarrased than she was.
 River: “I’m sorry. I couldn’t help myself. So, how are you doing, love. You 
doing well?”
Zevlor: “Yes, I’m fine. The preparations to move have been going well. We 
will be sending out some scouts with workers to begin cleaning up the place a
 little.”
 River: “That’s fantasatic. Oh, by the way, I do have to have a talke with you 
and Halsin. Could you find the time today? I mean, I have to go buy some 
things, but afterwards. Are you busy busy later today?”
 Zevlor: “I’ll make the time, sure. What’s it about?”
 River: “That’s for later.”
 Zevlor: “Very well. I’ll have to keep my curiosity in check until then.”
 He let her go and she went to her first vendor.
 River: “Mol! I’m happy to see you. I am in need of items. Perhaps you can 
provide all if not some.”
 Mol: “Tav! Of course! I got a bit of this and a bit of that. What do you need?”
 River: “Well, let’s see. I need blank journals, ink bottles, lots of quills to 
start.”
 Mol: “Huh? I never saw you as the poet kind.”
 River: “It’s not for me. It’s for my sister. She wants to take lots of notes. 
She’s a doctor, you know. I think that’s great. And she’s great, too.”
 Mol: “You have a sister?! When can I meet her? Is she as nice and strong as 
you? Is she pretty? Does she look like-… him?”
 River: “Well, let’s see. Soon, yes and no, she is stronger, yes very beautiful 
that the pretties flower does her no justice, and yes. Not my sister directly. 
She’s Astarion’s sister.”
 Mol whispered: “Do you mean she’s a vampire?”
 River whispered back: “Yes, but don’t tell anyone, yet. Please. That’s part of 
the reason why I’m here. I’m talking to the elders later today. Can you do that
 for me, Mol? Please.”
 Mol whispered: “Sure thing miss. I can keep a secret.”
 River: “Thank you so much. Now then, do you have charcoal sticks and 
empty scrolls, too?”
 So River was able to procure several items from the list and went to Mattis. 
She duplicated the items to give some extra items. She paid them and thanked
them and moved on to the next vendors. As she did, she tried to find Halsin, 
but she hadn’t seen him yet. 
She walked to the circle to get to the last vendors she needed. First she went 
to Dammon and got some extra gifts for both Petras and Dalyria. But then, 
she got lucky with Dammon. He had just tinkered with some ideas and items.
 River tried them on and found something that would be helpful with the 
bright light. She loved them and got two pairs. She paid him, too and took off
 to the last vendor. 
Finally, she got to Arron. From him she was able to procure some more 
clothes for both of them. She got them some things to sleep in and to be 
around the outpost. She even got dyes in case they wanted to change the 
colors of the items. 
By the end of her haul, she had gotten everything from both lists, additional 
things for them both, food for her, and her special gifts for herself. She then 
trodded off to find Halsin. It took a while, but she was able to do so.
 River: “Halsin. May I have a word with you?”
 Halsin: “River! What’s going on? What do you need?”
 River: “A very serious talk, the sooner the better.”
 Halsin: “Very well. Let’s go to a more private spot.”
 River: “Yes, let’s get Zevlor along the way. I need you both.”
 Halsin: “Now I’m getting nervous.”
 River: “I hope not, but you might I’m afraid.”
 As they walked, Halsin sent someone to get Zevlor and get him to reach them
 near the gate. It was far away from most folks and they would have enough 
privacy. 
River: “Gentlemen, I’ve got news. Now, I need you to give me a chance to 
explain and then you can have your onslaught of questions.”
 They both looked at her with worried faces, but agreed to listen without 
interruptions. 
River: “A day ago two of Astarion’s siblings found us exploring the vicinity 
of the outpost. They followed us there. Last night, two Tiefling scouts saw 
them at the temple with Astarion and I. I asked them to not say anything until
 I had the chance to speak with you both. I didn’t want to create a panic. The 
woman is named Dalyria, she’s a doctor-… was a doctor before she was 
kidnapped and turned. The man’s name is Petras. I haven’t spoken to him 
enough to know if he had a trade before. They are part of the 7. There are two
 groups of spawn. Seven thousand people were kidnapped and turned by 
Cazador in the time of 200 years. The first seven of them are the ones 
Cazador used to lure the rest. Astarion was the first man taken. Cazador 
forced them to do his bidding. Now that Cazador is dead, they have no master
 and most if not all are now residing in the Underdark. It’s a large place, so the
 fact that they saw us was a feat in itself. We haven’t finished preparing the 
outpost enough to even dare go and find them. The reason we went to the 
temple was to find some furniture to make them a livable space. There was a 
locked room that the goblins didn’t bother with, so we took things from there.
 That’s my report for now. Now, I’m ready. Ask away.”
 Halsin: “That is a lot to take in. Frankly, I’m not sure what to ask.”
 Zevlor: “Are we safe from them?”
 River: “I don’t know. They were warned. They have one chance to make a 
good impression. They know the rules. You lot our hosts and guests are off 
limits. Innocents are off limits. Any cattle owned by innocents are off limits. 
Failure to comply means the end of the line.”
 Zevlor: “But you can’t assure us that they won’t feed on any of us?”
 River: “That is correct. I cannot. I cannot assure you that they will stay away 
from any of you. I cannot assure you that any of you will stay put and not 
attack us, either. I can only tell you the consequences. They have the right to 
defend themselves if attacked. You guys, too. But I cannot assure you that 
they will keep their word. Hell, I can’t even assure you that I won’t lose 
myself in battle and never return to my mind. I don’t know.”
 Halsin: “But there are rules of conduct given? They have something to guide 
them?”
 River: “Yes, your people do, Zevlor’s people, too. We all do. The only 
difference with my people is that I cannot give them another chance. Halsin, 
you have prisoners still. And Kagha was tried and punished. You banished 
her. Zevlor, the children and pickpockets, thieves. You know it. Both your 
people have the grace of forgiveness. Mine will never have that grace. We 
have to work under rules so strict that your people would not be able to 
handle it. So, like I said. I cannot assure you  that they will follow them. I can
 only tell you the consequence when they break it. I have to kill the agressor, 
as much as it pains me. No more spawn can be created. We are a finite 
number of people. We don’t have the space to break.”
 Zevlor: “And what about the temple? Will they also share it with us?”
 River: “No. That has never been the plan. You will, if you still want it, inhabit
 the temple to keep it safe. Astarion and I will stay at the outpost and provide 
shelter for some. It’s a small area, we can’t take more land. The rest will have
 to disperse to other spaces.”
 Halsin: “What do you mean shelter?”
 River: “We will construct small rooms for them to stay and be safe from the 
trouble of the Underdark. At some point, I will have to go back to Baldur to 
get whatever I find in the ruins of Cazador’s palace to create spaces for the 
spawn to rest. They are a new people. They didn’t choose to be monsters. 
They were taken. I want to give them some humanity back. They’ve suffered 
enough. But I also want the Tieflings to have the same chance at a safe 
haven. You’ll be safer here than at Baldur’s, especially now that it is in ruins. 
But, I can’t keep nor force anyone to stay. That’s an individual choice.”
 Both men were not sure how to react. They had known about this, but having 
three vampires so near made them understand how real the situation was. 
River: “Look. I’m not looking for war between factions. To be honest, my 
wish is for all of us to work together and help each other have a dignified life.
 A safe space to live. I want all your peoople to thrive and grow. But, I want 
the same for mine, too.”
 Zevlor: “But you speak of them as if you were one of them.”
 River: “I am one by association. Astarion is my husband. They are his 
siblings. They were taken and turned by the same monster. They were 
tortured for a long time. I chose them to be my kin. But, I cannot be turned 
into a vampire. None of them have that ability. Their dead master was the 
only one that could make more and he’s dead.”
 Zevlor: “Tav, I’m sorry. It’s just that, I have my people to take care of and 
this-…” 
River: “I’m not shaming you, Zevlor. I care about you and your people 
deeply. I will always side with protecting all the Tiefling. But, you must 
understand that the vampire spawn are my people as well. I made an oath to 
Selune to protect her lost children. Your people and my people are under that 
oath. I am your champion and theirs, too. The only difference is that you give
 your people many chances whenever they mess up. I don’t have that same 
grace to give. I hope to the gods that my family never hurts any or yours, 
because if they do, we both will lose a member or more.”
 River was looking at both with a heavy heart. It pained her to know that it 
was the truth. They would have to learn to get along or they had to make the 
decision to do something else. Either way, the spawn will stay, and those who
 don’t follow the rules, have to perish. A single tear fell down her cheek. 
Halsin: “River, I understand. And I will hold you accountable for any 
misbehaving our your chosen kin. I also hope that we all get along for the 
benefit of all with Oak Father’s Blessings.”
 River: “And Lady Selune.”
 Zevlor: “Fine. I understand that yours and mine have been pinned as 
monsters, outcasts. I will find a way to get mine to also behave better. Let us 
hope that we are never forced to be against each other. Does this mean we are
 offically neighbors?”
 River: “Yes. We will be sister settlements. Even if the Druids still want to 
close themselves off.”
 She teased Halsin. He laughed in disagrement to that. 
Halsin: “Oh no! Our home will always welcome those who need safe harbor, 
Tiefling or otherwise.”
 River: “Well, then. Like I said, I don’t know when we will have more, but I 
will be reporting often if anything changes. So far it’s only us four. And we 
haven’t started construction. To be honest, I don’t know how many rooms we
 will make. We had just started to check out the land when they arrived and 
we paused.”
 Zevlor: “Well, we will likely start moving in soon, neighbor.”
 River: “And I’m glad. It’s a shame to see Selune’s Temple empty.”
Halsin: “Well, then that’s going to be a lot of work for the benefit of all. I see 
you are carrying a lot.”
 River: “Yeah. Dr. Dalyria is now able to get back to her scientific ways, so I 
got her extra journals and quills. And Petras went to explore on his own. 
They seem like really nice folk.”
 Zevlor: “And when can we meet them? If it’s not too much to ask.” 
River: “Well, not tonight. I will talk with them and see what they want to do. 
I don’t know if the want to stay or not, but I got them these things for they 
left the palace with nothing and arrived to the outpost with nothing. They are 
people first, affliction second. If they decide to leave, I will let you know. 
Otherwise, I will invite you down there or we can meet at the temple.”
 Halsin: “But won’t the temple hurt them?”
 River: “Well, it hasn’t yet. I believe that it is part of Selune’s blessing. They 
can be there as long as they don’t break the rules. Even Astarion hasn’t felt 
off while being at the outpost.”
 Halsin: “Oh yeah, I forgot. Hahahaha.”
 River: “Well gentlemen, that’s all I got. I must take my leave now. Thank you
 for your time.”
 They said their good byes and she left for home. She was glad that no wars 
began today. Also, she had found something clever to help her with the light. 
It didn’t take her long. She went through the portal and was home. She could 
smell that tea was served.
 River: “Since when are you drinking tea?”
 Astarion: “Since when are you wearing those things?”
 River: “Dammon was selling them. Says they’re called ‘goggles’. I like 
them”
 Astarion: “But why?”
 Dalyria: “Your eyes were hurting you, weren’t they?”
 River: “Creepy that you would know that, but yes. A little. I saw Nettie. Gave
 me some drops to help clean them out. But, by chance Dammon was selling 
these. I look fantastic.”
 Astarion and Dalyria looked at each other, but said nothing. River didn’t 
notice for she had begun to place the things onto the table from the cart.
