Chapter 15- Go!
 As they finished their rituals, they laid on their bed and closed their eyes. 
Perhaps this would be the last time they got for a proper full rest, or perhaps 
not, but for now, they take what they can get. 
The only benefit now was that Astarion wouldn’t have to prowl like a caged 
lion inside the tent alone. This time he had company. And Tav was great at 
teasing him for it. 
Tick-tock. Tick-tock. Tick-tock.
 When they went to bed it was almost 5 am. They slept for four hours. You do
 the math. 
Beep Beep! Wake up! 
This time Tav got up first and headed to the restroom. You’d think that they 
didn’t brush teeth, wash faces, and other things, but they do. We just don’t 
always talk about it. So, rest assured that even our boy brushes his teeth, 
especially him, because if not, ew. 
So, after Tav freshened up, she went back into the main tent and Astarion 
went to do the same for himself. He too went back into the main tent.
“What’s the plan today, my dear?, he said as he dried his hair.
 “To be honest, nothing much during the day. We’re caught up.”
 “Mh-… I’d thought you would go hunting or scavenging.”
 “I did considered it, but I still got some vegetables I need to use up and the 
fish. It’s still there and still drying.”
 “The fire still going? I’m amazed.”
 “Well,… no. But, it is still a little breezy, so the fish will be done by the time 
we pack up.”
 “Huh. Well then. What are we to do then?”, he gave her a coy smile.
 “You can’t be serious?! Again? Just how much stamina do you have?!”
 “Is this you complaining, my dear Tav?
 “I-… well-… no, but-…”, she was clearly flustered about his suggestion. 
He laughed as he got to her and kissed her.
 So, basically right now, we are going to play some cards, perhaps chess. 
We’re going to go make a snack and a drink, too. We can even go take a long
 nap. Because let’s be honest, Astarion and Tav, just like Halsin, are still 
elves. Now, search deep down in your media and lore, and well, you know. 
They will, and a lot. All over. Yes, that too. That other thing, maybe if she 
lets him. But, no. She’s not into that and she did tell him that if he was 
willing to also have it done, then perhaps. That shut him up.
Now then, they had fun. They rested. Had a bit more fun, etc. I mean, she did
 eat at some point, twice even. It was fish. She went outside to get the clothes. 
He help fold them and put them away. She still left the fish out. It was drying
 nicely. 
She removed the branches used as the clothes line, too. They were basically 
preparing themselves to get ready to pack up at night. But by now it was 2 
pm. So, let’s give them a bit more time. What can I say, time flies when 
you’re having fun, huh? But, yeah-… So, how are you doing? You doing 
good? I’m doing pretty well myself, thanks. Oh! Will you look at that it’s 
now 8 pm and dark out. Let’s go.
 Tav by now was looking all flustered with messy hair, but her man was 
looking way too smug, even for him. What can we say, he’s got vampire 
stamina, but she “don’t”. So, let’s just gloss over the fact they didn’t have 
time to shower. They were… busy. They’ll get to that after we all cross the 
river. 
Tav checked outside to confirm nighttime, and sure enough, it was dark out. 
Astarion proceeded to step out. He went straight to removing all the branches
 he’s placed to make the clothes line, and also recovered the rope he’d used.
 Meanwhile, Tav was picking up the things from inside. Pets all in a bundle 
and tied up, making sure that the one that was more water-resistant was on 
the outside. She left her toy plushies inside that bundle, too. We wouldn’t 
want them to get wet.
 “Tav, my dear-…”, he pointed towards the fish.
 “Oh, yeah. I almost forgot. Thanks.”
 She proceeded to take only the fish by shaking the meat to release the salt 
clumps and crystals from it. She left them on a little pile, then she grabbed 
her food pack from the backpack. She had some parchment paper which she 
would layer it with some fresh salt. 
“I think I have to leave the sack. I don’t have time to wash it.”
 “Leave it in the fire for now, there are still some embers.”
 “Good idea.”
 She put the sack, salt, and all right on top of the hot coals still burning, and 
they saw how some little pops would happen. They continued working. Now,
 he took down the rest of the branches he’d used for the drying rack. All 
leather strips and rope recovered, except the rope where the fish rested. That 
went to the fire, too. 
By now, the tents had nothing inside. Everything had been placed either on 
the cart or on the floor outside. He helped her remove the fastenings of the 
side, then to be the first one to take down.
She folded it carefully to minimize a bulge. He took down the larger tent, 
helping himself with his strength. This time, he wouldn’t be able to climb up 
to take the cloth over the frame. He just threw it from one side to the other, 
leaving the frame exposed. 
He stared at the frame, marveling at Karlach’s work. She was really clever 
when it came to design. She had the idea of making the frame from a metal, 
and it would lock in certain joints to allow for minimal space once stored. 
This went into his own pack, not that it would be a bother. The use of their 
bags of holding did wonders for his back and hers, but with the cart, it was 
even better. 
Together, they folded the larger tent and tied it up with the smaller one 
inside. It was place on top of the pelts. So, by now they were almost done and
 it had only been 30 minutes. They were fine. 
The hole for the side tent had been covered, she used a fire bolt, which our 
baby boy Gale taught her. Those two would certainly be dangerous together 
if left unsupervised. Though, Karlach have him a run for his money. Let’s be 
honest, the problem is our little chaos gremlin, but perhaps having two 
together, balances them out. 
They were ready to go. But there was just one more thing. They had to 
double-check. Little to no trace must be left behind of this vampire spawn we
love so much. So, Tav had to make a difficult sacrifice.
 She made sure she had her knife on her belt. Then she carefully walked up to 
him. He noticed her. His ears flicked. He turned around and saw her face. 
That was a dangerous face she was making.  She rushed in towards him.
 As soon as he felt the hilt of the blade crack it open, he knew. He gagged. 
She cackled.
 “That is disgusting!”, he almost shouted.
 “I know, but we have to cover our scent. We’ll have to shower after we cross,
 but I’d rather not linger in Berdusk. Too many of them, so we’ll have to 
survive it and them. I’m sorry, love.”, she said as she tried to stop laughing.
 He just rolled his eyes. He’d had his fun all day, now Tav was having a 
different kind of fun: annoy the pale-elf.
 “It’s still savage running at me like that.”
 “You would have jumped out of the way. Anyway, let’s run. It will gate late 
fast and we must be over the river by the time the light comes.”
 “Lead the way.”
 So, they set up at a good speed. Not a lot of talking happened, just the breeze 
hitting their skin. They were hyperaware of the area around them. They were 
like two lions on the hunt tonight, but in reality they were checking for 
threats. 
Despite Astarion wearing the dark glasses to hide his eyes a little better, and 
smelling of stink from Tav’s concoction, they had a nervious energy about 
them tonight. This was not home, it was not even Baldur’s Gate, were he had 
lived. This territory had too many pious violent ment roaming about. Tav was
 nervious. She could take them down one by one, but a stray arrow or a stake 
to the heart would be enough to snuff out two lives who were just trying to 
help.
 They began to smell fish, so they were almost there. They slowed down and 
their ruse started again. Tav started talking to Astarion, and he just had to 
follow along. Yes, and… 
“Husband, when we get to my parents home, help me wash up, will ya?”
 “Mh.”
 “My mother sent me a letter telling me the bedroom was ready for us and 
they baby if it came this time.”
 He was having a hard time thinking what to say, so he kept to one word 
answers. But it seem to be working either way, they saw a paladin make 
themselves known about  10 meters ahead. So, they stopped to double check 
their plan. 
Tav whispered, she was getting nervous. There were too many patrols in the 
city and outside of it and it was just them, too. She knew that they could take 
down many, but her goal was to infiltrate and get out without getting caught. 
She didn’t want anyone following them to the grove.
 “Very well, once we get to Moondown Isle, there will be a barge guarded by 
the Hellrider woman and the fishermant I made the deal with. She’ll 
recognize us sure enough. We look civilian enough.”
 Tav saw her current attire, a plain muddy red robe and leather sandals. 
Astarion kept his linen shirt with rubble v-neck and leather pants with boots. 
They were certainly not very interesting to look at other than he was a rather 
tall, fit albino elf with dark glasses, acompanied by a copper skin wood-elf 
that was 1.5 m tall. Surely, highly compatible and not at all noticeable. 
Either way, Tav had left her recurved bow and some loose arrows hidden 
between the buckets and the pelts. They could be reached in case needed. As 
for her bracers, she had none. They only special thing she had tonight was a 
hair piece that was actually fastened with 2 poison needles. As long as she 
didn’t cut herself with them, she’d be fine. She just had her dagger on its 
holste under her tunning which she could reach from the opening of said 
dress. She looked safe and weak enough to move about.
For Astarion, he had his own dagger on his belt. They both thought that as a 
man, it would be logical for him to wear one, but not her. Besides, he has 
fangs, and very sharp fingers and finger nails. He is his own weapon. 
He whispered back to her, still tingling with her anxiety in his tongue.
 “We’ll cross the Riverroad Gate first and keep going straight. From the map, 
it’s supposed to be the Uldoon Trail all the way to the other side.”
 “Right. That will lead to the Amberside Market, but we should be able to see 
the other exit gate out of the city.”
 “Correct, that’s the Vale Gate. Then we keep going forward, pretending your 
family is somewhere in those farms.”
 “Gods! I hope we don’t’ get stopped. I have no idea what names to say for 
those folks.”
 “I’m sure it won’t come to that. Anyhow, once there, we must keep forward 
and then break left and keep going.”
 “Easy enough. I think I want to vomit. Let’s go then.”
 “Oh, Tav. Are you sure you are ready tonight? We could go around the 
wall?”
 “I think it will be more patrolled. I just don’t like all these paladins sniffing 
us out. Before, we were at least 4 idiots and Gale was a great distraction. 
Now, it’s just us. We have a lot to lose.”
 “I agree. Well, Tav. I love you. Let’s go.”
 “I love you, too, my moon and stars.”
He leaned to kiss her forhead and she took his hand to kiss it. She grabbed 
Helen the cart’s handle and continued to push. Then stopped.
 “Astarion, let’s switch places. I’m supposed to be with child.”
 “Oh, right. Come on beast. Get a move on.”
 Helen Wheels just creaked merrily along like nothing was at risk. Just two 
reagular people and their little cart moving into the city at night rather than 
two apex predators pretending to be innofencive little lambs. A sight to 
behold indeed. 
She took a deep breath to calm herself. She saw the night sky to look for her. 
It always calmed her, but the cycle was not in her favor. It wouldn’t be until a
 couple of days for her to see her beloved moon guiding her with light in this 
darkness. She frawned, but kept moving. She was ready. It was show time.
 Astarion felt how Tav’s energy shifted from a nervious wreck to the predator 
he had known her to be. He knew their plan would work, for she had her 
common wild look about her. Whenever she focused her energy, she was 
dangerous. That’s why she was chosen to lead them before they defeated the 
netherbrain. But, he always wondered if she knew she did this. She was 
basically a loaded spring or a for us like a missle. She had an objective and 
she never missed.
 They could see the giant rock wall that protected the city of unwanted 
predators, but if said predators were pretending to be citizens, then the gates 
were open. The nighttime cover was surely useful for them now. Tav though 
Astarion looked less like his nature, but…
 “Slouch your shoulders. Also, keep your head a little down. Imagine you are 
some weak pathetic little boy. You still look too regal. You’re supposed to be
 sick.”, she whispered at him.
 He rolled his eyes. She just heard ‘tsk’, but he did as told. He knew she was 
in the ‘zone’, so she was noticing even the shadows of shadows at this point. 
It was rather sexy to him, having this woman being so protective. She was on
 the hunt and wouldn’t allow even a moth to touch him right about now. 
That’s hot. 
“Right then, I see them. It’s lucky they would have it there as opposed to the 
other side.”, she pointed to the barge.
 They could see the small Moondown Isle. Now, she saw that they could have 
simple walked across, but she was unwilling for mistakes. The little road 
could still allow water to touch his skin. Barge it was.
 She walked forger while touching her brand. It burned hotter tonight. Perhaps
 their daytime fun time had a lot to do with it. It made her wince, but got her 
into the mindset that she’s a poor frail pregnat woman who is collecting her 
ride. 
“Good evening, friend. Do you remember me?”
The Hellrider guard did recognize her and gave her a nod.
 “Ma’am. That I do. Ready to collect your crossing?”
 “Indeed. I’ve brought my husband and the mule, too.”
 “Certainly. But I need to check your cart to check for possible contraband.”
 Tav wasn’t too happy about this, but had no choice. 
“Of course, I understand. I must say, I do have my husband’s bow and some 
arrows. It’s been a dangerous road.”
 The guard indeed saw the bow and arrows and thought they were too small 
for him. Perhaps he was indeed as weak as she’d thought. It was insane how 
anyone would want to give a cursed albino a chance, let alone give him 
children.
 “Mh. Very well. Everything seems good enough. Here. This will allow you 
entry at the Riverroad Gate.”
 “Thank you, so much. You’ve been a blessing.”, Tav told the woman while 
touching her shoulder.
 Tav knew that sometimes, when she touched folks, she could affect their 
energy or emotions. Little did she realize that she began to develop that 
peculiar skill after a couple of months of feeding a certain vampire spawn. 
As for Astario, he simply kept quiet whild loading and helping Tav. She 
didn’t need the help, but they were commited to the bit. She moved to the 
center of the barge and said hello to the fisherman. He greeted her with a nod,
 but gave Astarion a weird look. 
The water of the river was surely dangerous to cross swimming, so she was 
glad they found a way to cross more easily. They could see the outlines of 
drying racks, and smaller boats and all sorts of plant life you’d expect on the 
edge of the river. 
As they moved, the furthes side of the Triple-Bridge got smaller and smaller, 
while the surrounding wall got bigger and bigger. His face was stone, so she 
hit him to knock it off. He softened his face and shoulders. He even 
commenced to pretend breathing again. She got closer to him, pretending it 
was cold, so he held her in a sort of half hug. This would allow him to fit the 
role better. 
“Ma’am, would you need to be escorted to your family’s home?”
 “Oh, bless you, but I don’t think so. See, I’m feeling a bit sick and need some
 fresh air. Besides, my brother is waiting for us at the Silver Sword.”
 “Very well, Ma’am. Well, here we are. Be safe in your travels. Sir.”
 The Hellrider guard noded to Astarionto say farewell as did the fisherman. 
Astarion nodded back and help Tav down before moving the cart slowly on 
to the ramp to get off the barge. Tav gave them a light bow and turned around
 to catch up with Astarion who had began walking towards the gate. Tav had 
the paper given to her ready to present it in case needed.
 The night guard was clearly half asleep, but had seen them just get off the 
bardge, so he didn’t move much. As Tav and Astarion got right to the 
entrance, he saw the paper and just waved them in while settling himself 
better on his stool. 
Two down, three to go. They kept moving with purpose. Rule one of not 
being mugged or stopped: move with purpose. Rule two: be confident on 
your steps. Rule three: if needed be, run.
 So far, the dind’t have to run. Tav turned around to see if the guard or anyone
 else was looking at them or following them. No one. it was too dark out and a
 little cold. Astarion kept scouting forward trying to catch patrols, but the only
 one he saw had turn to his left, likely towards a bridge.
 As they kept moving, sure enough, the brige was there. The passed several 
buildings like stores. They had passed by The Riverbarge and even Ondraer’s
 Fine Pages and then The Bellblade Throne. They were close to freedom now.
 They kept a brisk pace, her robe billowing in the wind. No onw seemed to be 
watching them, so far it seemed. 
“Hey! You two! Halt!”
 Tav and Astarion slowed down. His hand went to his dagger, but Tav put her 
hand on his forearm. She knew a fight would be worse, so she had to try the 
peaceful way first. The guard caught up with them. It was the same moron 
from Elturel. That  or he had a twin. 
Tav’s hand went to her mouth and slouched a bit. She was pretending to be 
sick. She was “pregnant” after all. Astarion moved closer to put his hand on 
her back to comfort her. He still didn’t talk. He did try his best to soften his 
look.
 “Oh, I’m sorry, ma’am. Sorry to bother you. Do you need some asistence?”
 “Just let us go to Tindar’s Own. I need something to eat. Anything to calm 
my sickness. The baby is hungry.”
 As they talked, another paladin aproached. Tav recognized this one, too. 
Lucky for her it was dark enough for them to not seem to notice her from 
Elturel. The second guard spoke.
 “What is it with you and pestering females?”, he said with some exasperation
 in his voice. He continued.
 “Not all women will be the wood-elf that told you off. Let it go.”
 “But, I-… I mean-…”, the young guard stammered.
 “No, you are still in training and I will have to write a report. The woman is 
clearly sick and needs to get a move on. Let them go.”
 The second guard, looked at Astarion with weary eyes. Then said, “Besides 
they don’t look like they mean any trouble. Just a husband and pregnant 
wife.”
 Astrion began to make the connection from what Tav told him. He thought it 
was hilarious that she indeed was the same woman that told him off. He kept 
that to himself. He looked worried still and Tav looked a mess. She’d 
managed to get her hair a bit more worse than before. It seemed to be 
working. 
“I’m sorry ma’am. We’ll let you be.”
 The second soldier grabbed the arm of the fires one and basicaly dragged him
 off down one of the many alley ways. 
“Fuck this city. I’m never coming back.”, Tav said under her breath.
 “Likewise my dear. That paladin seems to be developing a personal vendetta 
towards him. Jus what exactly did you do?”, he said quizzicaly.
 “I’ll tell you later. Let’s go. Just 2 more streets.”
 They crossed the market quickly enough. Despite being late night, now closer
 to midnight, there were still some stalls and people lingering about. That 
worked wonders for their cover. 
As they kept getting closer, Astarion saw another patrol moving closer. Tav 
decided to flick with force another vial forward for it to land in the road. The 
stench spread, but as they kept moving forward, they had to cross it. Now the 
area and some other unfortunate civilians now smelled the same as them. 
They would surely throw the paladins off. 
Sure enough, as people were wondering what happened and where the smell 
was coming from, these fake lamb kept moving while also looking around to 
“figure out” the commotion. The paladins were too entertained. The passed 
unnoticed.
 Then Astarion saw some barrels that were very near the exit. He swiftly 
separated from Tav and the cart. She kept moving it with one hand as she saw
 his plan. He was going to let them roll to get the attention of the guards at the
 Vale Gate. 
The noise had the guards run towards the mess of barrels, and away from the 
stinky couple passing by. Though they smelled, some paladins came running 
smelling like the same awful stench. 
Tav and Astarion made it out.  
Thankfully, with the little light that existed from torches scattered about at 
some places, it provided them with sufficient light to take notice of the 
general land. They’ve never been through here specifically, so it was new 
terrain.
 Immediately outside the stone wall perimeter of Berdusk, you could see some
 markent gardens where the citizens could buy fresh produce. Further along 
there were scattered homesteads with stone walls and thatch roofing and 
barns. 
You could smell the farm smells between animals in their fenced pastures, 
the animal waste they produced to fertilize the land, and the said crops using 
it. It all looked beautifu. This is what Tav wanted, but for her claimed people:
 the spawn. 
“It’s beautifu, too bad the religious freaks ruin it.”
 “What’s that?”, asked Astarion.
 “Never mind. Let’s go. Our ruse worked, but now we need to beat the sun.”
 Astarion made a face. Talking about this was still a sore topic, so she didn’t 
focus much attention on it. To her, it was just something they had to deal 
with, but she understood it was still painful for him to have lost his freedom 
to move as he wished, twice now. 
As they kept moving forward, Tav got her coin purse ready. She was going to
 do what she like to call “acceptable stealing.” You see, what she would do… 
well, just keep reading. She’s going to show us anyway. 
“I can smell some things over there. Come on.”
 Astarion already knew what she was doing, for he hear the coin purse jingle.
 “Do you really intend on overpaying for produce-… again?”
 “I don’t have change. Your coin purse is somewhere in the bag, and shut up. 
Let me be.”, she said as she stuck her tongue out while moving quickly into a
 homestead that had some produce in boxes outside. 
As she did that, he decided to follow but keep going. The cart squeaked a 
little, so he didn’t want to wake up the owners while Tav was taking what she
 could get. Besides, her food stash was down to the fish and some herbs. He 
needed her to eat more, and better. That and the fact that he didn’t mind her 
taking things. He just minded that she did leave too much coin behind. 
So, Tav quickly saw the tings they had. She was guessing prices, but had no 
idea, so she just left 7 gold coins and hoped it was more than enough. 
“Let’s see, I’m taking this box and these, that, and maybe this. Oh! This too. 
Mm-… I haven’t had this in a while-… I shouldn’t-… I should and I will.”
All in all her haul were about 6 potatoes, 4 yams, 6 sweet potatoes, 2 onions, 
and a bag of wheat. She left the coins right where the missing box was, and 
took off running. Astarion gave a little giggle without turning back. He’d 
seen her before. She always made a face as if she was stealing treasure. 
For you, sepctator, imagine Captain Jack Sparrow running away from the 
other pirates at that one beach. But this time it was a short brown elf with a 
crate of vegetables, wearing a white dress, or in this case tunic. Can you 
believe there are no dresses or skirts in Baldur’s Gate 3! Seriously, just 2 
items and the other one is basically underwear with gold accents! Okay, 
sorry. Back to business. 
She caught up to him and place the crate on the cart. Not really winded, but 
her breathing was a little heavy. The kept moving while scouting the land. 
They realised that it was still quite a way till the forest and the night’s sky 
was changing color. Time was running out. Also, they would have to follow 
the river back north having followed it south to Berduks. It couldn’t be 
helped. 
Tav realised that keeing closer to the river helped minimize Astarion’s scent. 
The water, the fish, the barges, everything left a lingering smell that was able 
to mask his vampire musk and her own. So, river it was until they entered the
 forest. Besides, that was her domain. 
As they kept moving, Astarion saw the oxen pen. Tav saw him.
 “It’s too big, my love. I mean-… how about the small sheep for now?”
 “Fine. I’ll do the one and a Tav, tonight.”, he said as he took off. 
“Seriously, that man. I would like the wool, though.”
 She noticed her little coin purse was gone. She smiled. It was still surprising 
to her how he was so willing to do things these days that would minimize the 
bother of others. She hated taking things without persmission, so her 
compromise was to leave more than enough coin to replace it. 
For so long she had not needed coin, so she simply made her own items. But 
since being with her friends, she learned that sometimes it’s just convenient 
to pay for some things. These days, she didn’t make her underwear and she 
also bought thread and needles. It made her happy that he took the coin purse.
 Then she noticed an old building that was partially collapced in the distance, 
which also allowed a pretty good access to the river. And she couldn’t see 
any patrols with torches nearby. Even the watch tower in the distance was 
still far enough for them to take shelter. So, she headed towards that building.
 Astarion, would be back soon enough-… with a poor dead sheep.
 Tav got her weapons from the cart and put them on. She felt naked without 
them. As she kept moving at a swift space, she was trying to hear for noice or
 notice scents. All sorts of things could be lurking and she had a scent that 
could attrack to a point and then repell, but why allow them to get near in the 
first place. Being vigilant paid off. 
Right when she was about to stop, she saw movement near the ruins she 
wanted to use for shelter. It looked like a giant dog. She saw it first, and she 
simply let her body take over. The arrow landed in between its eyes. Next 
thing she knew, she felt a swift breeze beside her and heard a thud.
 There was a sheep at her feet, and a vampire walking towards her with a bit 
of blood on the corner of his lip. 
“Ew”, she said making a face. 
“Begars can’t be choosers, my love. Besides, it’s best when it’s fresh.”
 “I know, but I didn’t notice you coming. Sorry.”
 “Not to worry. No harm, no fowl. Here.”
 He gave Tav her arrow back. It could still be used. He also gave her the 
quiver full of arrows from the unfortunate gnoll they just took out. It was the 
first one they’ve seen directly, all the rest were merely shadows and 
whispers.
 Then Tav spoke in a low voice. 
“It’s time. You reckon we should. I mean, the smell-…” 
“No worse than the stench we still have on now.”
“Good point.”, she took off running and got there in no time. 
He didn’t even wait for her to ask, he just took the empty buckets. She’d been
 so nervious before that she forgot to fill up the waterskins at the river, so 
she’d have to do those in the day time. 
She began to check the ruined building and noticed that there was still some 
part of the roof left and at least three walls, albeit not complete walls. It 
would have to do. 
She extetended the tent on the old cobble floor or what it seemed to be an old
 barn and took out the frame of the tent. By the time she was getting the things
 out, Astarion was back with the buckets. He placed them where they 
wouldn’t be knocked over and began to help Tav. 
Tav went around the area to place the warding stakes and throw a couple of 
enchantments, too. He goal was to keep any gnoll from stoping around lookin
 for the other one. She then went to get that body and drag it away. She was 
strong enough that it wouldn’t be an issue. She took her small spade with her,
 though. 
When she was far enough away, she began to dig a shallow ditch near 
enough the river to place the body. She checked it of anything of value first. 
Then she went ot collect dry grass from around the ditch. She found some dry
 branches and took those too.
From her back on her belt, she took a small glass vial with a yellowish liquid 
with a wax stopper. She removed the wax and poured the liquid over the 
body and the branches. She added the tuffs of grass all around, including the 
mouth of the beast. Then with the spell Gale taught her, she set the poor thing
 on fire. Then she spoke her blessing to cleanse Astarion’s work:
 From life comes death. From death comes life. The blood we take, we take 
no burden. The life we take, we give back life. Let this sacrifised life know 
it was not wasted. The flesh gives back to the nature it came from. The 
blood gives life to he who was robbed from it. The skin will give warmth to 
those that accept it. No part was wasted. No part will rot. Enter in me that 
which life rejects and let me birth it back into the energy of the universe. I 
will it by the fire that burns in me. I will it by the blood that runs through 
me. In perfect love and perfect trust. So mote it be. This is so, and it is 
done. 
As she finished her incantation, the fire burned a little brighter, but then it 
began to snuff out. The body was charred beyond recognition now. She 
stayed a little longer just to make sure it was good enough to be buried. Then 
she used her spade to throw dirt and rocks and whatever else was around to 
cover the it all. Then she ran back. In all, by now the process took about 5 
minutes. The oil she uses now helps speed up the fire. 
When she got back, Astarion had placed the frame and the tent cloth on top. 
The only thing missing was the side tent. She noticed that the floor was 
causing a bit of an issue for the frame, which ment her tent hole would also 
be. 
“Give me a minute. I’ll remove the rocks from it.”
 “Thanks.”
 While he worked on removing the stones, fresh dirt smell was filling up the 
space. She loved that smell of fresh dug soil. Perhaps that’s why she liked her
 man so much. Don’t you dare kink shame our girl. I like fresh dirt smell, too 
and I’m not with-… never mind.
 Because of the rocks on the ground, there was plenty of moisture on the 
actual dirt, so it made digging easy. She was able to finish up quickly 
enough. Then she told Astarion to head inside as she put up the side tent 
herself. She emptied out the cart and tied it to the frame of the tent, and took 
the things inside. She placed them at the entrance and he took the things to 
place a little out of the way.
 Finally, she placed the side tent from the outside, making sure it was secure. 
This tent had no bottom, so it was just the dirt that was dug out. She made 
sure it was at the proper incline to ensure the water they were going to use 
went away form the larger one. Then just one more perimeter check for good 
measure and she was done. She saw how the horizon was now getting 
orange. She gave a quick smile and went inside with the water buckets. 
“Honey, I’m home!”, she mocked Astarion.
 “Everything all right?”, he asked having seen her take the gnoll’s body 
earlier.
 “Yes. Nothing of value. Just a foot soldier. Poor sod. It’s over now.”, she said
 with a sad voice.
 He knew she didn’t like to kill unless it was a situation of “it versus her”, 
which is why she avoided getting into fights. She was stealth unless she had 
to attack. This was something he’d learn to do as well. The good thing was 
that it was working well enough. No waste and no bodies to take care of. She 
was very meticulous about cleaning up. Which reminded him of the sheep. 
When he came too, Tav was praying over it. He found that doing her 
incantation would keep the flesh from smelling for a couple of days. This 
mean, she would take care of it in the morning. She really did want the wool. 
He began to set up the bed pelts and the toys he bought her rolled out. 
“Careful! They’re precious.”, she bent down to pick them up and placed them
 on on the side of the pelts. 
“You remember when we spent camp with the gang? You never had the cloth
 on the floor.”
 “I didn’t think it useful to be honest.”
 “I know. Your tent was a mess. That’s why we played in mine.”
 She giggled as she blushed.
He hugged her from behind and whispered in her ear, “ And look at us now. 
A home and pure bliss.”
 He kissed her neck. She moved forward for him to let her go. 
“I agree, but, it’s time. We stink.”
 She stepped forward and started to pull at his shirt. He bent over to let her 
remove his shirt. she let it drop to the floor. Then she pulled at the leather 
buckle of his pants.
 “Aren’t we eager tonight? I don’t mind. I’m just pleasently surprised.”
 “Come on! Get a move on, young man. I will not waste water.”
 He now understood her urgency. She was going to wash “two birds one 
stone” again. That gave him an idea. A cheeky smile appeared on his face 
when she turned to head into the side tent. He followed. But she noticed.
 “Nope! Get the soap and washcloths first. I swear I think that’s all you think 
about. I’m not complaining, but you really have to find a hobby or 
something.”
 He laughed, “you are my hobby. You are teaching me how to love and live 
again.”
 “Point taken. Come along then.”
 As he entered the tent,  he turned right back. He’d forgotten his tooth brush. 
He knew her well enough to know he’d just ate literal “junk food”, so he had 
to clean up.
“What was that?”, she asked looking at him funny.
 “Almost forgot the tooth brushes.”, he said as he hander hers to her.
 “Thanks. Love you babe.”
 By now, she was nude. She was going to use the same soap for everything 
and everyone again. She still had about 1.5 k worth by now, but wasn’t about 
to waste it. Eventually, Astarion told her about that one kid in Elturel. She 
still thought it was a fair deal. 
She tugged at his underwear, too. She was intent on washing before going to 
sleep. She was surely tired, but was happy and grateful that the plan worked. 
It always took a mental toll. 
“Tav, let me help with that and you can focus on you. You look tired.”
 “Thank you. Yes please. I guess for now, let’s just hand it inside. The frame 
will hold and it’s not much.”
 “I agree.”
 So, they began scrubbing and washing and rinsing. The stink from the viles at
 Berdusk easily washed away. Tav remembered her earlier recipies of this 
stink liquid and how it had evolved. Now, it was easy to wash off, but it 
lingered if you let it. 
As soon as he wrung the clothes, she helped hang the things and they went 
back inside. It was his turn to be washed. She grabbed the washcloth and 
began to scrub his back. Then she did his neck. She also wrung the cloth on 
his hair to give it a good wash. It was becoming their ritual in the privacy of 
their little home. They would help each other wash the dirt and grime of a 
hard day’s night. 
“My gods! The towel! You now what? Forget it. Why do I even bother with 
it?!”, Tav said with mild annoyance. 
He just laughed. He forgot it too. 
They just walked out of the small and into the big tent. He headed to the pack
 for the towel. He figured they’d just share it. So, he helped her get dry and 
then did himself. Then she kept it on her hair like the strange bee-hive some 
women do.
 Between you and I, it’s crazy. Her hair is short. It’s to her ears, likely to keep 
her neck accesable for feeding. But that’s my guess. Anyway…
 “Astarion, are you-… peckish?”, she said shyly.
 He looked at her with surprise. He had just gotten some blood, but he wasn’t 
about to say no. It had been hours since he last drank from her. Surely, a little
 wouldn’t do much harm, would it? Probably not, but it’s her body, her 
choice. Same for him.
 “Well, no. I just ate. But, I wouldn’t mind a little nibble.”
 She laughed at that. Then he hugged her from the back and began to sway.
 “But first my dear, you have to eat something before and after.”
“I know, but I didn’t want to.”, she said begrudgingly. 
She moved away to go get the things from the pack. She had gotten all her 
thigs from the cart, which was now empty outside. The reason she was trying 
to avoid eating was that she no longer had bread or cheese. She had to cook, 
but she was feeling pretty exhausted. 
Astarion, taking notice of her current slowness, walked to her and began to 
help her with things. He wsn’t a cook per say, but he could help with prep 
work. 
“All right, Tav. What’s on the menu today? Potatoes, onions, fish?”, he made
 a face at the last one.
 “I think yes. Can you help me cut up a potato and-… um-… half the onion. 
“You can put the other half facing down on that parchment paper so it 
doesn’t stink up the place.”, she said as she was setting up her pot and pan in 
the other tent. That one has a window flap.
 “In there? Really?”
 “Yes, I’ll have to use some fire. This tent doesn’t have a cloth floor and it has
 the little window. It’ll be fine-… I guess. I just don’t want to go outside right 
now.”
 “Fair enough. Well, here you are. Where do I put them?”
 “Here. Thanks.”, she said as she placed the skillet in front of him.
 Her set up was rough, but it would have to do. She had collected some of the 
wood shavings from the shaft making in a small pouch, which now she’d use 
to help. Then with all the control she could manage, she cast fire bolt. She 
was using the pot as a safe way to control said fire, and had already openened
 the window flap and closed the main tent one. She’d smoke herself out. 
Besides, this side tent was a little loose around the bottom edge, so she also 
moved it a little up to open it. 
Due to the bulding corner they were using for cover, not a lot of day light 
was coming in. The tent indeed feel cooler than normal. So, she finished up 
her prep work. She now had some fish, potatoes, and onions all in pieces. 
Then she added water to it. This one being from the smaller waterskin, which
 is for drinking… obviously. 
As the fire started, she left it on the floor with the skillet on top. She used her 
daggers to help keep an opening between both the pan and skillet, so the fire 
could keep going and the smoke to get out. She went back into the main tent.
 Astarion had decided to not get dressed and was just lying on the pelts with 
his eyes closed. She smiled and blushed as she also had decided to not get 
dressed. They had gotten very comfortable with each other to not care about 
dressing up while inside their private world. This was theirs. No filters. Just 
them. 
She decided to not go to him just yet. Instead she stood by the flap and just 
looked at him. Her mind wanted to memorize ever inch of him as if it crucial 
that no line, no blemish, and no scar could be misplaced. The joy she felt in 
her heart knowing that this man, who very slowly showed her that she too 
existed not as a shadow, but as a person, a woman, was certainly something 
to be happy about. They had come a long way from that day of the boar and 
his dagger at her throat. 
Look at him being all perfect and beautiful. How in the hells did I manage 
to get someone like him be with me? I’m just a-… perhaps he has seen in 
me what I see in him. Either way, I’m glad that I got to meet him and be 
with him, if only for a moment.
 She then told him, “Astarion-… I love you. Thank you for choosing me, too.”
 He just smiled smugly showing just a little glimpse of fangs.
 He knew he was loved, a lot, by this woman, his beast of a woman. As he lay 
there, he remembered what had just occurred. How her movements flowed 
like the river’s current, silent, deadly, graceful. The way she was such at 
home being dangerous yet chose to be the opposite. 
This was new to him. He was coerced to do such horrible things for so long 
that he never thought he could change, but now he paid for sheep.
 I can’t believe that in less than a year she’s managed to unravel so much 
of what’s made me. And all through sheer stubborness of giving me a 
chance. Of all beings, this one chose the one that could kill her! But then 
again, knowing her, she can do that to me as well. Perhaps we were meant 
to be. Disturbing thought that I had to endure what I had in order to wait 
for her.
 He laughed mostly to himself, but Tav got his attention.
 “What’s so funny?”, she said now with a mouth full of food. 
“You, me, us.”, he gave her a smirk.
 “Same. I think it’s surreal. All of it. All of this.”, she covered her mouth as 
she spoke.
 “It is. I was thinking that perhaps this might have been fate. I don’t know. I 
guess what I mean is that I had to wait for someone like you to come along.”
 She almost shouted, “SOMEONE like me! You were expecting someone 
else? I’m offended.”
 She said this imitating his voice in indignation.
 They both laughed at this. But it was true. They got luck after having gone 
through so much. Now, they had each other to help on the bad days, but also 
to enjoy the good ones. 
She continued, as she kept eating her food slowly. There was no rush.
 “So, would you like to make a town like the one we saw outside of Berdusk? 
But like, under or something?”
“Mh-… I don’t know. I suppose we could try, but I haven’t really thought 
about it.”, he said now looking at her. 
“So, I have been toying with several things, but I think now is a great time to 
bounce off some of them.”
 She was very enthusiastic about her future plans with him and her found kin. 
That things would work out was yet to be decided.
 So here is a general list of things she’s considering to try or convince others 
to try:
 First, there is the idea of once seeing how many spawn are still grouped 
together, to create a sort of council. The idea is to have the older ones be 
heads of a small group of spawn. These groups being small in size. Perhaps 
groups of 10 to 15 working together to keep each other safe. They, Astarion 
and herself, would count as one head and lead a group, perhaps the more 
difficult ones. 
Second, speak to the spawns about creating rules with checks and balances. 
This means, setting up rules of behavior and consequences. She is afraid that 
letting so many spawn go rampant on any land will only lead to unnecessary 
chaos. She believes that they too have it in them to rejoin humanity in their 
own way.
 Third, with them, create a sort of meal plan so that they get the sustenance 
they need, but allow people to go about their business without fearing they 
won’t return home, like it was done to them.
 Fourth, create a business plan. They will need coin, all of them. They will 
need housing, too. They need the same things the living do, but perhaps not 
entirely the same ways. She wants to see if they could potentially create 
caravans or settlements of spawn to help each other and protect each other.
 Fifth, she was really wanting the creation of community services to help one 
another. She knew by now that many of them, especially the youger spawn, 
still had a recollection of their past. Some had been doctors and carpenters. 
She was certain that perhaps they could teach one another skills to help grow 
their community. This included offering therapy to those who seeked it. 
She was well aware that they had all gone through something horrific. She 
was also aware that most if not all are feeling scared and alone. They lost 
everything when they were stolen. She wanted to give them a chance. 
In her mind, she was not given a chance, so she took it by force. Now, she 
had a loving partner and their little home, which sure was a tent, but it was 
theirs. She really wanted the spawn to experience a calm life despite their 
curse. 
As Astarion heard her insane ideas, despite his best efforts, he couldn’t help 
but be intrigued and a little excited. He was now very different from who he 
was months ago and it was due to this woman full of spunk. She wanted to 
share her joy with his kind. That’s all she was looking for.
 It almost make me upset to recall that he considered ascending for power. He 
would have done that for himself, but this one was putting her life in danger 
not only because she wanted to be with him. She also wanted to share her 
happiness and joy with others like him for the simple reason of “it’s only 
fair.” As if it was her fault the seven thousand were cursed because she 
messed up. She wasn’t even alive for most of it. 
He came back to the present.
 “I said what do you think, Astarion? Too much? I know it’s crazy, but 
couldn’t we at least try to talk to them?”, she said with a lump on her throat. 
He knew she was scared, but her fear was not for her. It was for them. She 
didn’t want them to be hunted forever. In her view, they had the same right to
 live, love, and thrive, despite the curse that was forced on them. But it would 
be a lot of hard work.
 “I’m sorry. Yes. I do think your ideas or plans are surely impossible, but I 
think that we should at least try. I think there might be a few that could 
consider the idea.”
 “I agree. That’s why I’m so nervous. I mean, none of you can make more 
spawn, so that can be used as leverage when it comes to the living. I mean, if 
we are going to fight for a space to be. But that means, we must take care of 
everyone that wants to join the good fight. I just hope they can see my insane 
logic.”
 “I hope so too.”, he said with the same uncertainty that she had. 
It was a far fetched plan, but that’s all she had for now. 
She stood up and took her skilled back into the side tent for washing. She 
brushed her teeth, washed her hands and face, and then went back in. Then 
she got on the pelts beside him. They snuggled, him with one of his arms 
behind her neck and she snuggling on the side of his chest.
 They kept chatting.
 “Tav? Would you have liked to become a vampire?”, he asked in a soft voice.
 “Mm-… to be honest, no. I mean, I think that vampires can’t love. At least 
that’s what I understood from that demon. Perhaps, like you, a freed spawn 
would be fine. I mean, I wouldn’t care either way to be honest. Though, like 
this, being alive, we can achieve more. For example, you have a lot of 
strength and can dazzle folks into doing your bidding. But, I can buy things at
 shops during the day, have you try them on, and in case needed, go and 
changed them before the shops close.”
 He laughed. Here he was thinking she might go into something more 
philosofical regarding living forever and she was thinking of shirts and pants.
 “Tav. Never change.”
 He leaned in to kiss the top of her head. 
“I won’t then. Are you sure, though? I mean, I know I’m still rough around 
the edges and well, you’re still a man from high society. Look at me having 
you sleep on pelts hiding in a delapidated barn. This is no place for a man 
like you!”, she sat up with a bit of a panic.
 He thought about her reaction.
 I swear this woman is insane. I’m a natural killer and she’s worried that I 
lay on pelts! 
She continued.
 “The thing is that I don’t see you as a vampire or spawn or whatever. I just 
see you, Lord Astarion Ancunin, Magistrate at Baldur’s Gate. A noble high 
elf who was attacked by a gaggle of gur, which resulted in him being infected
 with an incurable disease that he can’t spread. It’s just that to me, you are a 
man, someone who has no reason to be with a feral thing like me.”, she said 
the last part looking down. 
Despite everything they had been through and everything she had learned, 
she still focused on the wrong thing. She thought of herself as inferior 
because of class. She felt it with Wyll then, too and even with Gale. 
She saw her friends as people with manners and being of high society. 
Lae’Zel was more military like, but all of them had grown with rules and 
costums. She was robbed from hers. She felt like she belonged nowhere and 
as such, it was hard for her to believe a noble man would spare her a thought.
“Tav. Have you felt this way all this time? Do you think that you shouldn’t 
be with me because I was noble born? Seriously woman. The way your mind 
works is impossible. I love you. Only you. I stopped being a ‘noble high 
born’ the moment I was taken. And sure, the rest of the group along with 
myself did grow up in society, but I don’t think it matters. All of us combined
 are missing what you have ten fold. You have heart. Just look at the things 
you have achieved before us, with us, and after us. You are more deserving 
of palaces and crowns than any of us. And now, you are still risking your life 
for a group of feral spawn just because you are dead set on giving them a 
chance at life! In my time on this land, I’ve never met anyone like you. If 
anything, I’m the one that is undeserving of someone as special, as important,
 as magical, as impossible as you, Tav.”, he said while lifting her chin so she 
could look at him.
 He wiped a tear from her eye. This was something that still bothered her, the 
feeling of being inadequate or less than. She saw him as this impossible 
being, beautiful, strong, intelligent, charming, deadly, but she didn’t see the 
same qualities in herself despite having them. The only difference they had 
was that she had a lot of heart and he was just starting to grow one because of
 her. 
“I-… I guess.”, she hiccuped.
 “No, I guess. It is true. Would I lie to you? I mean, now. Would I lie to you 
now?”
 “No, you wouldn’t.”, she avoided his eyes.
“Come again?”, he questioned her to force her to look at him.
 She looked at him.
 “Oh, Astarion. I know you wouldn’t. But, I can’t stop feeling this. I’m-… I’m
 nervious that you’ll meet another like you and that you’ll leave me.”, she 
cried.
 There it was. She was scared, but for the wrong reasons. She was sure that 
Astarion would be better off with another spawn with a similar situation. In 
her view, she was very much alive, always a temptation. She also had to do 
things to stay alive. She had to cook, clean, and have a tent. The very things 
that he found so fascinating, she found them a hindrance to his well being 
and comfort. There was clearly a disconnect here for both. But it was Tav and
 she’s always seeing things in a different way. 
“WHAT?! LEAVE YOU FOR ANOTHER?!”, he couldn’t help but shout in 
surprise.
 He continued, but with a calmer voice.
 “Tav, my dear. No! I wouldn’t even be able to share you with Gale and he 
sure as hell wanted you. Had he not been so stuck on Mystra, he might have 
beaten me to the punch. Same for Wyll. I got lucky you thought he was 
royalty, too. Hell, even Karlach was dissappointed that I got to you first. I 
basically had to fight against them to get your attention and by then you 
already love them! I swear woman the things you focus on never stops to 
surprise me. So, no Tav. You said I belong to you and that you belong to me. 
We are stuck together even if it is to be miserable together.”
She laughed at that. She had told him that back at the inn at Elturel. 
“I’m sorry, Astarion. Is just that-… since I was alone most of my life, too, I 
always felt inadequate. Whenever I would visit the towns, people whispered 
saying horrible things about me. I was just there trying to sell my things and 
learn from them. I was interested how they could all co-exsits but not be 
violent like my clan. But, they didn’t have to use knives to cut. They saw me 
and would laugh. I mean, now with your help, I don’t dress like I did. But 
before I simply made my things. Sometimes, I’d see nobles visit the towns 
and they were the worst. So I just learned to avoid them. Then I met you and 
you treated me nice. It was great. I finally got to meet a noble man and he 
wasn’t an asshole.”
 “Oh, wow. Now that’s a twist I wasn’t expecting.”, he said not hiding his 
surprise.
 “Yes. That’s why I paid attention to you more. I mean, we met Wyll time 
after. But, despite of you being sassy and nasty, I saw that you were 
pretending, too. Like me. I was pretending to be human. I knew I was feral. 
Most folks in the towns I visited said it. They tolerated me because I didn’t 
cause trouble and my products were good. And I know that they took 
advantage of me when it came to trade or coin, but I didn’t mind. I like bread 
and cheese. You can’t find that in the forest. So, you see, I had to learn how 
to be human by watching you lot. It was great fun, but difficult. There were 
times I dind’t understand what you guys were talking about. It wasn’t until 
you and Gale helped me with my reading that I began to get better. I’m 
thankful.”
“Mh-… that explains so much. I apologize, but I also thought you were more 
like an animal at first. There was this wild look to your eyes as if you were 
always on the look out for danger, but when we were in a job, your eyes 
changed. You were almost like me, a predator. Your deadly focus and 
ferocity was always a sight to behold. I think that’s why Lae’Zel and Misora 
respect you. Hell, I would even dare say that Misora acturally likes you 
because of how you fought for her.”
 Tav laughed a little. “You think so? I’ve always thought she hated me, 
despite it. She enjoyed saying nasty things to you because she knows it got 
me angry.”
 “I know. If looks could kill, you’d have destroyed her a hundred times over.”,
 he laughed as he remembered how Tav one time, she almost did. He 
continued.
 “But, I need you to understand that you’ve grown and learned so much. I’m 
really proud of how far you’ve come and I’m glad I’ve had the chance to be 
here to see it. You will always have this fereal edge to you, but now you’re 
better focused. I mean, you’re making plans with a vampire to create a 
commune. What feral animal would do that? Even more so, your reasons is, I
 think, noble. You want to give them a chance back at live. It’s insane, but I 
want to see if it can be. If just out of curiosity, really.”
 She smiled as she wipied another tear. Then she leaned in towards his 
stomach and blew a raspberry. Real hard. He jumped a little. She started 
laughing. 
“Thank you, Astarion. You always know how to make me feel better.”
 “Uh, you’re welcome, my little weirdo.”, he rolled his eyes. 
He couldn’t believe she’d done that but was afraid she might start doing that 
more often. But in reality, he didn’t mind. He was learning and accepting that
 her love language mimicked animals in nature. Nipping, biting, sniffing, you 
name it, she would do it, had done it, and would do again. He felt lucky to 
have this now though. Besides, she was teaching him new tricks, too. And 
that was certainly rather fun. 
“By the way? You hungry? I’m ready.”, she said looking at him with a smile.
 “I wish I could say I’m fine, but I can’t say no to you.”, he said with a 
seductive smile.
 She giggled and playfully punched his shoulder.
 “Stop dazzling me. It makes me tingle all over.”
 “Then I’ll keep doing it. I want to see what happens when I do.”
 “Ah! You know what happens!”, she laughed as he pushed her on to her 
back.
 She looked at him and marbled at how this man, with all his history, was now
 capable of a gentle touch. She was glad she gave herself to him and he did 
the same. He then kissed her. She kissed him back. Despite her exhaustion 
though, her body always craved for him. He took notice. His body craved 
hers too.  It was as if they were trying to make up for 200 years of lost time in
 an instant. 
She wispered into his hear while she hugged him as he kissed her. 
“Astarion, take me.”
 He straightened to look at her, lust in his eyes. He knew he didn’t need her 
voiced confirmation, but hearing his name on his lips was always something 
he desired. She moved her head to allow an easy bite. He smiled and then 
showed his fangs and bit her.
 She allowed her body to relax as she felt how his fangs pierced through her 
skin and she felt how his bit still felt like a shard of ice that then numbed her 
senses. By now her pulse no longer quickened like it did at the beginning. 
No, now it was pure arousal for her. This was theirs. It was erotic for him to 
have her, for her to be taken. 
He also felt it. Her taste let him now she was enjoying this dangerous act. but 
her body showed him with presicion. Her hand went up to his head, straight 
to his hair. He felt how she pushed him more towards him while a little  
moan escaped her lips.
He finished his feeding and licked his lips. He saw her face, a smile full of 
bliss. She enjoyed this as much as he did. His impossible woman, indeed.
 They allowed their bodies to simply enjoy each other’s touch. His body was 
on top of hers, feeling how her own heat produced sweat. He liked the 
wetness that her stomach and breasts left on his own skin. Her scent was now
 on him and that was madening. Then he moved his leg up to catch hers to 
make it easier for him to enter her. She didn’t protest.
 As he began making love to his woman, his mind drifted to an encounter they
 had in a job they’d taken. He didn’t want to admit it then, but he’d claimed 
her for himself long before now. All the group knew it, but they pretended on
 one noticed.
 The job lead them to recover something stupid like always, but it would 
allow them intel and coin. Thus they agreed. They all split up to loot and look
 for the thing. Astarion never bothered with looking for anything for he knew 
he could get away with pretending to look for it. He just knew if he followed 
Tav just enough, she’d vouch for his participation. Clever little rogue he was.
 So, he knew Tav tended to go down the ruins and caverns for she had pretty 
good eyes sight unlike some of the others. Another benefit was that she 
wasn’t a ‘princess’ like Shadoheart, so Tav was more capable of tolerating 
cobwebs and odd smells. And true to Tav’s nature, Astarion found her in a 
deep corner of the ruined palace. She’d found her one of her favorite finds, a 
little studio with bookshelves. She was perusing the shelves’ titles with a 
little candle she’d found and lit. Though the light was dim, it gave her enough
 to see clearly in this odd darkness. 
As she was looking over the spines of the books, she was distracted enough 
to not notice a certain spawn walking slowly towards her. But then she placed
 the candle holder down and removed her bow and set it down. Astarion was 
curios to see what she was about to do and to his surprise, he didn’t expect it.
 Tav was fidgeting with her pants. She unbuckled her pants and pulled them 
down just a little. Then she was adjusting her underwear. She was wearing a 
thong, but she was trying to adjust it while mumbling under her breath.
 “That’s the last time I believe those girls about this. Thing is eating me up!”
 Astarion couldn’t help but laugh and that’s when she finally noticed she 
wasn’t alone like she’d thought. In her panic, she dropped the candle to the 
floor and they were again in total darkness. 
She said in a  panic, “What are you doing here? Shouldn’t you be looking for 
the sword?”
 He got closer to her, “I am. I was. I found you. You seem to be in need of 
assisstance.”
“No. It’s just-… these tickle me. Whenever I move, they keep rubbing on me 
and I can’t-…”
 He knew she was flustered and he knew she arounsed do to a poor choice in 
under garments.
 “Then may I suggest you-… take them off.”, he said now next to her.
 She gasped. Then she giggled.
 “No, I’ll have to wait until we get back to camp and wear my normal ones. 
Shadowheart said I should try them, but I regret it with a passion.”
 As soon as she finished, Astarion couldn’t help himself and kissed her neck. 
She gave soft moan. By now, it was difficult for Tav to pretend she had no 
feelings for him. In her mind, she was playing her role well, “we’re just 
friends.” No one believed them. 
They gave each other hidden glances here and there. They’d always, 
somehow end  up together in a recovery quest. Then there was the night 
feedings. 
Tav, giving her best effort of a whisper spoke.
 “Astarion. Careful. The guys are moving about. They might see us.”
 “Mm-… is this an invitation to just keep quiet. I can do that.”
 As he said it, he found her wetness in her crotch. He had moved his fingers 
under the sad piece of cloth that was the culprit. And indeed, it was a real 
problem for her. He smiled as he began moving his fingers in circles around 
her aroused clit. As he did, she held on to his arm and clawed her nails into it.
 As he reached down to kiss her neck, he purred, “careful now, Tav. I don’t 
want you to finish just, yet.”
 She muffled a moan and agreed with her head. She couldn’t say no to him. 
She desired him, too.  With her shaky fingers, she unbuckled his pants and 
began to pull them down to reach in for his shaft. As her warm hand touched 
his skin, he gave a little jolt. He laughed a little. Then kissed her on the lips, 
using his tongue to part hers and end enter her. His tongue looking for hers 
with a little too much eagerness. 
Her soft hand began to clumsily move up and down his member, like a velvet
 caress. 
“Oh, woman. You surely know how to get my complete attention.”
 “Astarion, please.”, she whimpered.
 “Please what, my pet?”, he purred into her hear.
 “Take me.”
 Right on cue, that was all he needed. He lifted her up as her arms were now 
free, so she pulled her pants letting them fall with a soft thud. She kicked the 
test of pant legs off. She straddled him with her legs.
 Then she reached behind her to gently lead him inside her. His cold sking 
slowly entering her burning wetness. Her breath hitched, but she loved this 
feeling. He began moving, slowly. Her thoughts were a mess. All she could 
focus on was how her own body was very aware of this man’s movements. 
She kissed him again, but bit his lip. 
“Mm-… seems like you are liking my efforts, my dear Tav.”
 She moved her neck to expose more sking, and he kissed and sucked on it. 
He wasn’t ready to bite just yet. Instead, he placed her down and turned her 
around. As he did, he lifted her blouse, exposing her breasts and stomach. 
She felt the coldness of his hands on her skin and enjoyed how the cold trails 
left a lingering sensation. Then with his leg, he spread her own to allow him 
entry once more. He held her tight, lest she fall over. He kept kissing her 
neck and felt how she was now at his total mercy. She was giving in to him 
completely and fearlessly. 
Then she found him again rubbing outside of her wetness and guided his 
thrust back inside. They both gave a light moan. Her eyes were closed as she 
enjoyed this man that was loving her. His were too busy looking at her 
enjoying ever moment in a random mirror on the wall. She hadn’t noticed it, 
but he had. 
Though he couldn’t see himself, he could surely see how every caress, every 
touch, was taking her to nirvana. His name on her lips took him right with 
her. He kept pushing himself inside her. Her arms were holding on for dear 
life on his thighs. Though her nails were dinging in, he found pleasure in it. 
She wasn’t meaining to hurt him, but she was enjoying him too much to 
realise she was digging in. She was reaching her climax and he was racing 
right behind her.
 “Astarion, bite me.”, she whispered while her eyes were closed.
 He did as he was told. Anything for her. He bit down and felt how her blood 
rushed inside him as he kept going. It was the most delicious she’s ever 
tasted, almost forbidden. But, she was his and that’s all that mattered. He 
kept thrusting. She finally let go of her senses. Her litle death. He caught up 
to her as he ended his feeding. Then he licked the bite he gave her and began 
to kiss her neck again. Her body went limp, exhausted from reaching the 
heavens with him. He removed himself from between her legs. She smiled.
 He was thrilled. He wished he could see his reflection right about now. The 
proud gloating face he had deserved to be admired. After all, he’d just made 
Tav melt into him. He had just laid claim to her. And he was going to make 
sure no one interfered with that fact. Tav was his, and his alone. 
Meanwhile, neither him nor Tav realised the show they had just given. Turns 
out that despite trying to be quiet, some sounds still carried and had brought a
 small audience of two shocked, yet very quiet voyers. Wyll and Gale had 
witnessed it all. Their hearts pounding in their hearts, clearly aroused by the 
event they had just witnessed, but had been unable or perhaps unwilling to 
leave. Either way, they accepted the facts. Tav was his willingly. Astarion 
was hers by her choice. They decided to leave once they were coming back to
 their senses. Wyll had seen Astarion’s ears flick which told him they had 
little time to leave before Tav was fully back and notice them, too. 
They knew she wouldn’t appreciate her two friends gawking at her half 
naked body while her vampire lover was still holding her as she regained her 
strength. But Astarion now did have a knowing smile. He was sure that those 
two would finally stop trying to get her attention. After all, he knew that all at
 camp could hear when he entered Tav’s tent at night. Astarion knew that they
 all knew feeding wasn’t the only thing that took place at her tent after 
midnight. 
He turned her around right after he pulled her blouse down. She was a fit of 
giggles.
 “We’re so bad.”, she giggled as she was trying to keep her voice down.
 “Indeed, my pet. So, about those. What do you say if we trade?”
 “WHAT?!”, she quickly covered her mouth. Then repeated herself.
 “What, what do you mean?”, she asked again.
 “You’ll wear mine, and I’ll keep yours. Mine won’t cause you the tickle, as 
you said.”, he say with a coy smile.
 She thought about it. Her eyes and her eyebrows scrunched trying to fall the 
problem in his offer. There wasn’t. His were not like hers. She wasn’t going 
to use these again anyway. Besides, it wasn’t like he couldn’t grab them after 
she tossed them, so might as well just gift them, right?
 “Fine. Keep them. Weirdo. But, I’m keeping yours if they are comfortable.”
 “Sounds good by me.”, he said as he handed his over and held his hand out.
 She put his on and giggled. They were a little big, but she liked how they 
looked. He just put his pants back on and stuffed hers in the pocket. 
“I’m keeping them. I’ll buy some more like these next town we visit.”, she 
said as she began to get dressed. 
“I’m sure you will, my pet.”, he said as he kissed her neck again. 
Then she picked up her weapons and began walking back out and up the 
stairs. But Astarion, as he followed her, said coily,
 “Good thing no one was here to watch us make love, my dear. But if they 
had, they would’ve loved the show.”
 He knew the other two fools were still there, hiding in the shadows. They 
figured it was best to lay low to not make any noise.
 Tav tried to shush him, “Shush it. This didn’t happened.” But her muffled 
giggled said the opposite. But Astarion just laughed. None of them ever 
revealed what happened that day. Little did Astarion know then that he was 
sure to find out what it meant to claim this impossible woman.
Meanwhile, she was also reminiscing her claim to her chosen man. But her 
mind went to their darker escapede. This time she remembered Cazador 
Szarr’s Palace. 
They were all on edge, but Astarion was worse. He was jumpy and jittery and
 for good reason. You don’t simply walk into hell. But this time, he wasn’t 
going to be alone. He had the whole gang, and he had his biggest champion; 
Tav. 
They were scouting the rooms on different floors. Karlach was having a blast 
and even Lae’Zel and Shadoheart were enjoying the stealth mission. They 
were all exploring, learning interesting intel, and knicking things that were 
easy to stuff into their magic void bags. 
The plan was to find any information possible and then meet back at the 
entrace or somewhere nearby. Astarion figured that the people would be in 
the bottom chambers, so there wouldn’t be many above. But still to be very 
careful. There could be traps or worse lingering around. So, they all spread 
out. 
Per usual, Astarion and Tav left together, him guiding her through the halls 
of his horrid past. He didn’t know what he was looking for, but he couldn’t 
stop running. Tav knew he was terrified and lost. He didn’t know what to do.
They reached one of the furthest rooms and he openened the door. He 
stepped inside and she followed. The room was a bit small. There were some 
bunk beds on the side of the wall. The walls were stone with some long 
tapestries to decorate them. There were candles that provided enough light. 
Everything was regal but wrong. You could feel the sickness these walls had 
witnessed.
 Astarion eyes gave him away. He was spiraling. Tav forced him to sit on one 
of the available chairs. And then she held him while he sat. She ran her 
fingers through his hair as she hugged him. Her fury was trying to escape her.
 This was the hell that her Astarion had was stolen from by the parasite. 
From one hell into another. He deserved that all the divines beg for his 
forgiveness in her view. He’d done nothing but live his life, and then this. 
She spoke in the softest voice.
 “Astarion, hold on to me. I won’t let them take you. Not ever.”
 He did as he was told and hugged her waist tightly. She held on to him, too. 
Her legs between his, his face on her chest and stomach. He took in her scent 
to calm down. She smelled of wild flowers and dirt after the rain. It was 
comforting. She was comforting. 
“Tav. I’m scared. I don’t know if I can do this.”
She let go to look at him straight into his eyes.
 “Look at me, Astarion. You are not his anymore. You have to finish this. You
 know you do and you’re the only one that can.”
 “But, what if I’m weak? If I take his place-… all that power-… I-…”, he 
whispered while averting her gaze. 
She held his chin firmly to force him too look at her again.
 “You have to choose your next path. I know you know the consequences of 
either choice you make, but it has to be you who decides. Or you can wait 
here and we’ll handle it.”
 “NO!”, she said loudly.
 “That’s what I thought. Are you ready to go and finish this?”
 “Yes. Let’s go.”
 She let him go and started to walk towards the door, but he held her hand and
 pulled her back towards him. He was now standing, but his eyes were 
different. There was a fire in them now. He was ready to get the revenge he’d
 been desiring for centuries. Tav look up at him. She wasn’t afraid, but she 
didn’t understand why he stopped her. 
“Tav. I need you right now.”
 “I’m right here, Astarion. I’m not going anywhere.”
 He kissed her passionately and she understood what he had truly meant. He 
wanted to desecrate the palace’s rot with the love he’d found in Tav. He 
needed to begin his vengance here. She desired to defile everything that 
Cazador stood for. She desired to make love to his beloved puppet. She 
needed to claim Astarion for herself and this was the best place to do so. A 
sort of “fuck you, Cazador. I’ve stolen him and now I will fuck him in your 
home”. So, she was more than willing to let Astarion have his way. This time
 it would be on Astarion’s terms. His freedom from his broken chains would 
start here, in this room. 
Tav began to pull at his shirt to get it off him, but he stopped her. He instead 
unbuckled her pants and pulled them down. Then he did his own. She 
stepped out of the pile on the floor. He kept looking at her with a fierce 
intensity. Then he sat down on the chair and beckoned her over. She did as 
she was told. Then she got on top of him. She guided his shaft inside her.
 As she was about to moan, he caught her mouth and began to kiss her. Now it
 was her who was claiming him. He then stopped kissing her. He needed to 
see her face as she thrusted her self on him. He needed to see her pleasure. 
And she needed to see him. 
This time is was as if two defiant animals were mating to see who would 
break first. Neither did. She sped up. Her breathing quickening. Her heart 
pumping faster as her legs did all the work. Then he hugged her tight and 
stood up. Her legs hugged him tightly while now it was him doing the work. 
He moved them to the wall and used it as support. He kept pushing himself 
inside faster and faster. He was starting to feel that it would be long until Tav
 climaxed. Her eyes were giving her away. He decided to bite her. He needed 
a clear mind and this was the best way. As he fed, he  quickened his pace and
 felt how Tav’s hips were now matching his own. She was there. He felt as 
her walls clenched and she bit into his shoulder. He knew what she was doing
 and why. The wilds had raised her and this was how animals mated. She was 
claiming him, too. He stopped feeding.
 He licked her wound and kissed her on the lips. The metalic taste of her own 
blood still on his lips. She smiled as she came back.
 “Astarion. I love you. Everything will turn out fine.”
 He was surprised for this was the first time she let it slip out. She loves him. 
Him of all people and here of all places. That’s all he needed to hear. She 
wasn’t expecting for him to say it back, though. He had to finish this circle of
 hell in order for him to accept her love. But, she could wait 200 years, too. 
He let her go. She walked back to put on her pants and handed him his. She 
fixed his hair and also hers. Then they walked out and went to meet the 
others. None needed to know that they had reclaimed his power from 
Cazador. Astarion was free and would never allow anyone else to claim him 
for he was now on his way to becoming Tav’s one and only. She knew it 
then, but Astarion still needed time to accept it.
As she came back to the present, now she was on top of him while he 
mesmerized her body as she moved into her own passion for him. Then her 
back began to arch and he just held her hands so that she didn’t lose balance.
 They both reached the climax they were seeking and finally she gave. She 
fell on top of his chest. She was out cold. He smiled and rolled her off him. 
Then got comfortable with her in his arms. 
He understood that all that had happened had led them to this point, but they 
were just getting started. Their future was uncertain and her ideas were 
insane, but for the first time in forever, he had a reason to try and truly live 
again. That’s all she was asking. Try to live life to the fullest. He was ready 
to do just that, as long as it was with her. Then he remembered the blue box 
inside his pack now. He would have to keep it in his pocket very soon. 
But for now, they wait. They rest.
