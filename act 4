Chapter 6 – Exploring options
 River: “Right then. So, you two will just keep looking at each other or you 
want to tell me what’s going on?”
 Dalyria shifted uncomfortably and Astarion grabbed the second pair of 
goggles she had just placed on the table.
 Astarion: “River-… these goggles. Are you having trouble with your eyes?”
 River: “I went to see Nettie. She told me her speculations. I got my own. And
 I think it’s half and half.”
 Dr. Dalyria: “What do you mean? Who’s Nettie? What did she tell you?”
 River: “Well, let’s see-… Nettie is a druid healer. When I got out of here, I 
felt my eyes stung. I walked to the Grove with my eyes closed and kept them 
closed. They sort of felt like I had sand in my eyes. Zevlor saw me and took 
me to Nettie.”
 Astarion: “I’ll have to thank him personally.”
 River: “Yeah. So, she checked my eyes and made Zevlor very uncomfortable 
with questions about me and Astarion’s relationship. The usual, how long 
have I allowed him to feed on me and what about sex. My guess that your 
silence confirms that she is probably right.”
 Astarion stood up unsure of what to do. 
River: “My theory to add here is simple. We’ve been living in the Underdark.
 Bodies adapt when you do something for long enough. Of course my eyes 
would hurt. They’ve hurt before when I’ve gone up, but this time they hurt 
more-… well, at least for longer. They don’t hurt down here. You are 
welcome to poke and prod at me if that calms your mind.”
 Astarion: “Don’t say that! You could be having some irreversable changes to 
your body and you take it as a joke!”
 River got angry at that. He was going to blame himself and she knew it. 
There was nothing more to hate than people absolving her of her own wrong 
doings. She was not happy with him right now.
River: “Don’t you dare, Astarion Ancunin. Do not dare blame yourself for my
 own choices! I gave myself to you because I wanted to, so I’ll be damned if 
you come now and regret me! Don’t you dare. It’s my body and I accepted 
any and all consequences. I had nothing to live for, yet I have. I do not regret 
anything I’ve done except Rikkon. But I do not regret you. Whatever may 
come, I gladly accept. It’s my life and my body. And you know what else? 
I’m going to leave now. I am so mad at you right now. I’ll go check on 
Petras. I have a feeling he’s not back home, yet. Dalyria, I’m deeply sorry 
about this outburst. I apologize. I’ll be back later.”
 She gave Astarion a kiss on the cheek and took off. She needed to vent. She 
ran to get momentum to climb the broken tower and she was gone. Astarion 
sat down with his head down. He felt defeated.
 She’s angry for all the wrong reasons. What am I going to do with her?! 
Her body is changing and it’s my fault! And she’s angry at me for calling it
 out?! She’s never been this angry at me before. I need to go after her.
 Dr. Dalyria: “Astarion, wait a little. Let her cool down. She seemed really 
angry at you.”
 Astarion: “She was. She’s never been this angry at me before. But, she’s 
wrong. I did this to her! I’ve been selfish and I’ve taken advantage of her 
good heart. And she blames herself?! As if she was the one who demanded I 
drank. Why?”
 Dr. Dalyria: “I don’t know what I can tell you. You know her better than I do.
 But I can suggest that you give her some space. My guess that this wasn’t 
entirely the reason why she was on edge. She did go to the Grove. Perhaps 
the reason was because of us, Petras and I.”
 Astarion stood up again and began to walk to his room.
 Astarion: “She bought plenty for you and Petras. You are welcome to take 
your things. I’m guessing everything except the food is for you both. And 
Dal, I’m sorry for bringing you into this mess. Please forgive me. I have to 
cool off, too. Talk to you later.”
Dalyria looked back at him and agreed with her head. Then she stood up to 
look at the items and arranged them on the table to see what was there.
 Earlier today, Petras had decided to try his luck in the Underdark, but this 
time with the supposed protection of his new sister. He was dying to find out 
what it meant. So, he left. He was very excited to see what was around. 
Do they really mean to have a place of my own? That’d be fantastic. I get 
to do what I want and have over who ever I want. I can drink form 
whoever I want. Oh, but-… didn’t she say if we kill anyone, the game is 
over? Play nice? But why should I?! No one came and help me. I had to 
survive on my own. I deserve my freedom. 
As he moved forward, he had manage to not be in the sight of the statues. 
Though he was curious about them, he wasn’t ready to try his luck that way.  
He had explored a bit around and had even stayed at a rock with a sword 
stuck in it. He spent way too much time there trying to get it out. He wasn’t 
successful. He kept moving about. Pretty soon, he noticed that there was a bit
 of a trail and followed it.
 This side of the Underdark feels a little too quiet. Perhaps there is a 
settlement here already and we don’t know about it. I’ll follow this path 
and see what’s there. Who knows. We can get lucky and find a new spot. 
Mh, the place they made is pretty nice, though. Very clean. Huh-… it didn’t
 hurt to be there. Isn’t it supposed to be blessed?
 Petras: “What do we have here? I’m going to check it ou-… Ah!”
 He misstepped and fell through a weakspot on the wooden platform in the 
storehouse. A nasty fall, but he was strong enough to not get hurt, just some 
faint scratches that would be gone within minutes.
 Petras: “Damit Petras! If Dal finds out about this she won’t let me out of her 
sight. I’m tired of a baby-sitter.”
He stood up and dusted himself off really annoyed with his blunder. Then he 
realized something bad.
 Petras: “Fuck! I lost the rock! She’s going to kill me!”
 Quickly he scrammbled to look for it. He pulled at the floor boards trying to 
find it there. He saw some glowing crystals and took one to aid with the light.
 He was getting desperate. 
Gods dammit, Petras! You always have something to prove and now you’ve 
lost the first sign of trust. I got to find that rock.
 He kept looking for a time in the same spot for a while longer. Still nothing. 
Petras: “Perhaps I’ll just clear my mind and keep exploring. I’ll come back 
later. But, I’ll be more careful this time. There’s a lot of stuff around here. It’s
 probably hiding something.”
 So, he used some of the netting to get around the area, though he was still 
annoyed with himself. He really wanted to prove he had what it took to be on
 his own but he couldn’t keep a rock safe. 
So, he decided to look for trouble, perhaps a little snack. He kept pushing 
forwards. He found a little distraction. 
Back at the outpost catching up to where left off, River had left to find Petras.
 The problem was that she couldn’t see. Her eyes burned, and her throat felt 
sore. Finally her emotions had caught up with her once more. 
She stayed right outside of the outpost, sitting on the bridge or the outpost. 
She was crying silently. 
Fuck this is so hard. I want them all to get along and it feels like at a drop 
of a pin, all of them are going to explode. Not even my birth clan was this 
intense, and they are insane. But I am, too. I mean, serioulsy? I want to 
make a conven of vampires and expect the Tieflings to say “yes, let’s be 
neighbors with blood sucking people that can kill us” Who am I kidding? 
They are right to be afraid. But, I just want them to live. Is that so much to 
ask? They all deserve the chance to be happy and to feel free. Gods! My 
heart-… But, I won’t give up. My Astarion always says I’m stubborn. If I 
put my  mind to it, I will find a way. I will prove that he is wrong. He is not 
my downfall. He is the reason I will succeed. He will live again. His 
siblings will live and thrive. And my Tieflings will finally be respected in 
this gods forsaken land! You will see Elturel! They will be strong. You will 
bow down to all of us together. Or I will die trying. Now where is my stupid 
potato housband? I’m going to give him a  piece of my mind!
 She stood up and wiped her tears off. She had to believe that Petras would be 
find, though she understood Astarion. She also found Petras to be a bit of a 
fool, but with the heart in the right place. She’d have to trust he’d return well 
enough. She decided to get back inside. Right when she had crossed over, she
 heard some screaming and turned back. 
Petras: “Oh fuck!”
 So, our dear boy had managed to find a minotaur by itself moving a little 
over the storehouse and thought it a great idea to play with it before feeding 
on it. Which was a bit of fun. It bashed into him, he let it happen. The 
minotaur tossed him a few times, but then Petras finally stopped playing. He 
dug his teeth onto its neck and drained it. The problem was that as soon at he 
was done, 2 more were charging at him. He felt too full. He decided to run 
back home. He was having too much fun. So, he forgot about the two statues 
infront of the outpost. 
It was too late to dodge. He had to keep forward or the minotaurs would 
catch him. The statues were already powering up. By the time he shouted, 
two strong radiant beams shot from the satues and passed right through him.
 River quickly climbed back to get outside, but as she was on top of the tower,
 she saw how Petras crouched down as the beams passed through him and hit 
the minotaur on the back. The statues kept shooting and River launched 
herself forward to pull him in and away from the beams. He was just in 
shock.
River: “Petras, my sweet boy! You’re fine! It’s fine. Come. Let’s get back 
inside.”
 He looked scared but excited. His smile conflicted with his eyes. 
Petras: “So, that’s what you meant?! This place is insane! Did you see how it 
burned them to a crisp?! But, I felt it pass through me? How? This is-… 
how?”
 River: “I know. I don’t get it either, but this is it. That’s why I said to play 
nice and you’ll be fine. Even I have to follow the rules or I will be burned to 
a crisp, too. I don’t know how divines work.”
 She laughed a little. Then Petras looked at the floor a bit ashamed. He 
remembered his fall when River started dusting him off. 
Petras: “River-… I-… I-… fell and um-… I-… I-… I dropped my stone. I’m 
sorry. I tried to look for it but I couldn’t find it. And then I came running and 
the statues-… I thought I was done for. But, nothing happened to me. And the
 stone-… I mean-…”
 River: “It’s just a rock Petras. I got more if you want another. The blessing is 
not in the rock or the outpost of anyting tangible. It’s a blessing as long as 
you accept that it is. The blessing that was granted to us was because we are 
willing to live our lives for the good of others and ourselves. As long as you 
can do that, you will be fine. The rock is just a rock.”
 Petras: “But you said we should plant it if we want to have our own space? 
Why? What for?”
 River: “Simple. It is easier to believe in something if you can touch it, feel it, 
see it. You see that statue inside? Our Lady isn’t there but she is. You don’t 
have to understand the divine. All you have to do is accept that if you do 
good onto others, the divines will smile upon you and yours. But seeing her 
there is a reminder of our vow to do good. Do you get it now?”
Petras was not sure what to say, so he just smiled and kept moving. She 
climbed first and he followed. He was glad to be back in his new home and 
that he wasn’t scolded for losing just a rock.
 River: “You should probably clean yourself off. There’s water in there. Also, 
Doc found your list on the floor and gave it to me. Your things should be in 
the  kitchen. If not, they might be in your room. Now, if you’ll excuse me. I 
got a few choice words for your brother.”
 Petras saw how her face turned from sweet to angry in a second and was 
certainly glad Astarion had done something so wrong that she didn’t get mad 
about the moonstone. So, Petras went to the tent to wash up, and then he 
would check out his new things.
 Petras: “This Place is pretty great. Food, shelter, and no master to beat me. I 
think I’m going to enjoy it here for a long while.”
 River walked to her and Astarion’s room. She was annoyed more than angry 
now. As she passed by Dalyria’s room she leaned in and said in a soft voice.
 River: “He’s back. He’s safe.”
 Then she kept walking. Dalyria stirred inside and went to get her brother to 
his room. She had a feeling that it would be better if no one stayed in the 
kitchen for now. So, she greeted him and helped him carry his things back. 
They stayed talking in his room about the events.
 Meanwhile, River had gotten to their room and touched the hidden entrance 
wall. 
He was lying on his back with his eyes closed. The room was lit with the 
torches, so it was bright for both. She stepped in and touched the wall for it to
 close behind her. She quickly moved to pin him below her and not allow him 
to move. She kne that he wouldn’t try to mover her or he could drop her to 
the floor. She was sure he wouldn’t try to hurt her. And this is why she was 
angry. She wasn’t made of glass. He wouldn’t try to hurt her eventhough he 
could. 
He felt how her legs flexed to tighten her grip. She was stonger now than 
what he remembered. Her hands went to each side of his waist. She was 
grabbing hard but not to the point of digging any nails. It was just a strong 
grasp. But her face, she was furious.
 River: “Look at me.”
 Astarion opened his eyes and opened his mouth, but nothing came out.
 River: “Shut it, pale boy. No, on second thought. Don’t shut it. What the 
fuck? What the actual fuck, Astarion? Please, enlighten me with your side of 
the story. Tell me what are my faults and mistakes that you are so willing to 
carry. Tell me my fucken burdens that keep you spiraling into oblivion. Come
 on. It’s not like I’m going anywhere. And you’re not going anywhere either. I
 said look at me.”
 He tried to not look at her. If looks could kill, she’d set him on fire. 
River: “What? You now can’t say a word after you threw a fit about my eyes?
 You’re driving insane, you know that. One minute you are there to bounce 
ideas and help and the next you are blaming yourself for my actions. For fuck
 sake! I made the choice to be with you. I’m not here out of pity! I’m here 
because I want to be with you. Because you are my asshole! Mine! And now 
you regret me because my body is changing?! Let it change. It’s adapting to 
better fit my needs. Live bodies adapt. Nature shows you that if you’d pay 
attention. Nature changes all the time. My body was bound to adapt, too. I 
like it. It’s good. I dare say it’s better. I am less tired now after you feed. I 
heal faster, too. I have even improved in my sight in darkness. Not as good as
 yours, but better than before. I’ve been training it. That’s why my eyes are 
sensitive. They’re just tired, but so am I. I’m stressed and worried, and-… 
I’m scared.”
 Astarion: “River-… I-…”
River: “It terrifies me that in your journey to protect me-… to keep me safe, 
you still think the best way to do so is to leave me. What else can I do to keep
 you? Haven’t I done it all? Tell me then! What else do you need me to do so 
that you stop trying to leave me to keep me safe. What? Astarion, please-…”
 She finally whept. She understood his side of the story, but he needed to 
speak his truth, too. They still were learning to communicate better. But they 
were always willing to try. 
He let her cry on his chest feeling her tears on his skin. He placed his arms 
around her as she finally decompressed. He understood this was not just 
about him. It was about everything and she just needed a good cry. 
Sometimes you just need that to help you reset. So, he let her have that before
 he spoke. 
After a while, she finally calm down and sat up again. She wiped her eyes 
and cleaned her nose with her top and then removed it. She threw it on the 
floor. 
She kept looking at him. He exhaled which was more out of habit rather than 
necesity. 
Astarion: “I was talking to Dal. There is a chance, though almost impossible, 
but still there that I could get you pregnant. But the only information she was 
able to get says that if it does happen, the woman dies.”
 He then turned his face to the side. He didn’t want to look at her reaction. He 
was still scared of that revelation. He was scared to admit that he wanted the 
option but not at the cost of her life.
 River: “What?! Come again?”
 She was not sure she heard that right. 
Astarion: “Sigh. They are a sort of hybrids. They are of both worlds. Dal 
speculates that if your body is having changes due to my feeding and our 
intercourse, and accounting my own changes, that there could be a small 
possibility. But, you won’t survive.”
 He reached for her and pulled her in to hug her. She let him. They stayed like 
that for another while. Both lost in their own thoughts.
 She was thinking in her chaos.
 I can give him a child?! What?! Dame Aylin, is this what you meant? But, 
what?! I must ask Gale. What if we can use magic to keep me safe? Or 
perhaps my body is changing to withstand it? But it’s too soon. We’ve got 
so much work to do? But fuck it! I want it if I can do it. Gods! This is great
 news! Imagine a little shit kid like his dad! I love them already. What if I 
can have another? How would I look? Could I be a momma? That would 
be great. I’ll show you Draeven! I can be an amazing mom and you will 
never get to touch them. Hahaha imagine me with little tykes. Imagine 
Astarion. Oh, I wish I could give him at least one. He would be an amazing
 father. He deserves his legacy to be carried. He’s changed. He’s a good 
man. He’s a great man.
 Meanwhile, Mr. Spirals was going on in his own direction.
 Hells! She didn’t take it like I needed her to take it. Now, she will focus on 
that. Does she want to die? I can’t allow it. I’d rather not ever get the 
chance if it means she stays with me forever. But, a little one with her fire? 
Her smile. Gods! I would have prefered never learned about this rather 
than hope for it. But what if it does happen? I mean, the possibility is close 
to zero, but what if it does happen? 
River: “Talk to me.”
 Astarion: “I don’t want to lose you.”
 River: “What am I to you?”
 She sat up again to look at him. 
River: “Astarion, what am I to you? What are you afraid of?”
 Astarion: “Everything. You are my everything. I don’t want to lose you.”
 River: “And you believe that you will?”
Astarion: “Yes.”
 River: “How?”
 Astarion: “What if-… what if you die if you did get pregnant?”
 River: “What if I grew wings an a beak and a cat ate me? This isn’t it. I know
 you. Cut the bullshit. Dig.”
 He tried to look away, but she was right. This was part of it, but not all of it. 
He had to dig. It had been a while since she cornered him, but she had to, 
again. 
Astarion: “This whole ordeal. You having to be the mediator for three 
settlements. You having to build spaces for so many. I see how it’s taking a 
toll on you. Then, your body is changing and it’s because of me and now I’m 
afraid that if I make love you, there’s a risk of a child that could kill you. 
How do you do it? How do I help?”
 River: “You can start by not making me feel like you will shut away because 
you’re afraid to lose me. That makes me feel lonely. I am holding on by a 
thread and you are my anchor here. Then you push me away because you’re 
afraid of loosing me. Make it make sense, please.”
 Astarion: “I-… I don’t know how. I’m trying, but-…” 
River: “I get it. We are broken. We can’t ‘fix it’, but I told you before, you’ve
 to try. Help me help you. Hell, help yourself. I’m not made of glass. And I’m 
not a damsel in distress.”
 Astarion: “I know that. But, this is the first time I’ve been with someone-… 
someone that cares. Truly cares. I’m going blind. Nothing of what I used to 
do to charm works with you. And you hold me accountable. I’ve become a 
man because you push me to step up. Hells! I bet I wasn’t even a man before 
I was turned. But, when the idea of becoming a father-…”
 He turned  away, but she held his chin. 
River: “Look at me.”
 Astarion looked back : “I want it. I desire it. I wish it. I not only want to 
make love to you. I want that love to be something more. But I’m afraid to 
lose you.”
River: “I told you before that ever if I could if it wasn’t with you, then I 
didn’t want it. I want it to be with you. You are a great man. A wonderful 
husband. A formidable warrior. You are my Astarion. And you would be an 
amazing father.”
 Astario: “Don’t-… please.”
 River: “Yes. You know I believe it’s true. And if there is a chance, I want to 
take it. I deserve a chance to at all the blessings and you along with me. I 
gave you part of my soul. You are my life. You deserve to get back the 
blessings which were stolen from you.”
 Astarion: “River, please-…”
 River: “You deserve to feel loved. You deserve to be happy. You deserve of 
all the good that may still come your way. You have done so much for so 
many. You deserve to be blessed. You deserve to have me. You deserve me. 
You have me. And I have you. Let me have you.”
 Astarion: “But, you could die.”
 River: “And that’s part of nature. I can die from an infection. I can die from 
laughing too hard. I can die of a broken heart. But as long as I am here, I will 
live. I will experience everything fully. Besides, you can die too.”
 Astarion: “But, it’s harder to kill me.”
 River: “Bet?”
 Astarion: “You know what I mean.”
 River: “Let’s do a compromise, then. Again the possibility is low, but if I 
were to succeed AND I start showing signs that it is causing obvious harm-…
 we-… we terminate. We can tray again in the future if possible. We’ll-… um
… We’ll monitor my body. How does that sound?”
 Astarion: “Terminate? I don’t know-… I mean-…” 
River: “It’s a compromise where it is balanced. If it gets dangerous, one will 
have to be sacrifised. You know it’s true. You win. You get to keep me. And I 
get a future chance to try again.”
 Astarion: “It’s a hard bargain, but-… I guess we can try it.”
 River: “Very well. Now, what else is eating at you?”
 Astarion: “The next summit.”
 River: “So far, the waters are still calm. But, I want them to meet. The 
Tiefligns will soon move in. It shall be arranged. You will have to go this 
time. You are their representative. I’m just the mediator.”
 Astarion: “I hate it. But fine. I’ll talk to them to prepare them.”
River: “Anything else? Come on. Dig.”
 Astarion: “I hate the goggles.”
 River: “Good thing you don’t have to wear them. I like them. And I find you 
very sexy when you wear yours. It’s very hot.”
 He gave her a smile. 
River: “Come on. Dig.”
 Astarion: “Fine. I apologize for blaming myself for your choices. I don’t 
regret you. Happy.”
 River: “Lame ass. But, I’ll take it. Now, then. You have to do something for 
me. Repayment for causing me grief. Unnecesary grief.”
 Astarion: “What?! Ugh, fine. What do you want.”
 In a mocking tone he said:
 Astarion: “I promise to do whatever I can to atone for my sins.”
 She gave him her evil grin. 
River: “That’s good to know. Then, Astarion Ancunin,-…”
 She leaned in to whisper in his ear.
 River: “Fuck me so hard I forget who I am.”
 She turned to kiss him and began tugging at his shirt. Then she began 
grinding over his pants as her hands pulled his shirt over his head. She kissed 
his neck and nipped at him. Never to cut, but enough to leave a mark this 
time. Then she kissed him again. 
She bit his lower lip a little more. Her legs holding him tight as she continued
 to grind on him. She could feel how he was surely enjoying it. She kissed his 
shoulders and bit them. She went down a little further. Again sucking at some
 areas, kissing others, and biting him. She wanted him to feel it. So, she bit 
hard enough for him to react, but not enough to draw blood. 
Then she went back to his lips. His mouth was a little more open so she got 
her tongue inside and found his. She loved his taste. A little moan escaped her
 mouth. He laughed as she kissed him with an urgency. 
She kept grinding faster. He grabed her butt with his hands and pulled her 
into himself. She moaned again. Then he undid her bra. Now her breast were 
free to move as she kept griding. 
He was mesmerized as he saw her. Her body arched back, her breast 
bouncing. Her nipples hard. He reached in to touch them. With his thumbs, 
he began to play with them, feeling how hard they became. The wrinkles in 
her areolas felt so good on his fingers. Her soft breasts heavy but soft. He 
wanted to taste them, but she kept grinding. 
She knew that this was driving him mad. But she wanted to do just that. Now,
 it was her turn to have him after the spiral. It was only fair.
 Her hips were now moving in a circle. His hardness and the cloth of his pants
 was rubbing her just the way she needed. She shifted between grinding 
forward to back and then in circles. 
She felt the vibration on his chest as he was lightly growling in pleasure. He 
needed to take her, but she wanted to keep him like this a little more. She 
stopped. Then started. Then stopped again. She was good at copying his 
tricks. He noticed. He was done. He grabbed her and stood up while holding 
her. 
He turned her around and pulled her pants and panties down, bent her 
forward and found his way in.
 Astarion: “Your wish is my comand.”
 His grunt of pleasure was just as loud and her moan. He began to penetrate 
her as he held her arms for balance. First slow then faster.
 River: “Harder. Harder. Yes, like that. Mmm-…”
He could feel how she felt like a vice grip. Everytime he was inside her, she 
would contract. It made it feel better. He pulled her up. She moved her leg 
out of her pant leg to spread her legs enough.
 Now his arm was holding her under her breasts while his right arm went 
down to find her clit and began rubbing. Her arms were gragging at his 
thighs. Now she was clawing at his skin. He liked it. He pushed harder. As 
hard as he could and she was taking it all. She began to shake. Then she bit 
her lower lip to not let her moan escape. He reached in and with his right 
hand moved her face toward him to kiss her. Then reached down again and 
continued rubbing. 
He caught her moan. He felt how her body was shaking again. He smiled. He 
kept going hard. Then he felt his own body finaly reaching climax. He 
stopped. Then he turned her around and lifted her up. He sat on their bed and 
now it was her turn. He held her to let her focus on him. She began grinding 
on him again. She looked at him as she felt how he slowly entered her again. 
She had to pause. She didnt’t want to climax yet. She wanted to hold on as 
much as possible. Her hips would move quickly then slow down. He could 
feel how her hearbeat was as wild as she was. She was taking deep breaths. 
He liked how she was focused on pushing herself but not cracking. 
Then she saw his face, his faint smile. She kissed him again, her arms 
holding his neck. She felt her own skin heating his again. Now his chest 
wasn’t cool. He was heating up. She moved faster. Her legs stiffened. 
He stood up and kept grabbing her and found a  wall for support. Now, it was
 his turn again. He began moving again, as deep as he could go. Feeling her 
legs just bouncing as he had grabbed her from under to let himself enough 
room.
 He knew this position opened her up to allow her clit to rub on his own skin. 
River: “Look at me.”
He opened his eyes and kept moving fast as they saw each other. She was 
trying to control the next wave, but was loosing control.  He leaned in to kiss 
her again and this time it was him who found her tongue. That’s what it took. 
Her hips began to shake again. His own body echoed hers. He was again 
feeling the burn inside him. 
River: “Bite me.”
 That was the sign. He could never say now when they were like this. He bit 
her as both were riding their orgasm together. He felt how his last pumps 
inside her gave way to his own seed. The intoxicating feeling of giving her 
his seed while drinking her blood made him climax again. 
He licked her neck clean. 
River: “I love you. Never leave me. That’s an order.”
 Astarion: “As if I could. I’m yours forever.”
 He didn’t let her down. Instead he carried her to bed and laid her down then 
he got beside her. He held her. 
Astarion: “I’m sorry for today. I’m still learning how to deal.”
 River: “I know. Me too. I’m not mad. I was stressed. Frustrated. I’m better 
now.”
 Astarion: “Me too. Let’s fight more often.”
 River: “Hahaha. Sure. We hadn’t had sex like this since you fucked me in 
front of the mirror.”
 Astarion: “You knew about that?!”
 River: “Lae’Zel told me. Gale and Wyll saw us and stayed. Perverts. Bet they
 liked the show, though. I looked amazing.”
 Astarion: “Hahaha. Yes, you did. And you still do.”
 River: “Do I still have to tell you that you are beautiful?”
 Astarion: “Mm-… yes. Yes, you do.”
 River: “Astarion Ancunin, you are the most beautiful man I’ve ever seen.”
He hugged her tighter and kissed the back of her head. They were spent. 
They now rested. 
So, as our love birds where fuffling their feathers, the other siblings were 
chatting while ignoring the slapping sounds that carried with the sounds of 
the Underdark. 
Petras: “No wonder he likes her. She’s good.”
 Dr. Dalyria: “Petras! Stop trying to hear them. Give them their privacy.”
 Petras: “What? It’s true. She gives him a run for his money. And she’s pretty, 
too. And very scary. How can the small ones be so vicious?”
 Dal just rolled her eyes. Then tried to guide the conversation to any other 
topic. As long as Petras stopped trying to talk about Astarion’s sex life with 
his wife. 
Dr. Dalyria: “So, what did you find? Anything of use?”
 Petras: “Well, there was this sword-… and then-… I’m sorry, Dal, but would 
you mind taking the conversation outside. They are very distracting. Fight
sex is louder, it seems.”
 Dal giggled but agreed. They quietly walked out of the Outpost and went to 
sit at the bridge instead.
 Petras: “Right, well it sounds less. Hahaha. If she didn’t scare me, I’d tease 
them. But she does, a little.”
 Dr. Dalyria: “I like her. She cares about us and she is madly in love with 
Astarion. I’m glad they found each other. It gives me hope for us. Perhaps 
one day we get lucky, too.”
 Petras: “I agree. It’d be nice. So, yeah. Anyway. I went that way. There is a 
sword stuck in a rock, but it’s really stuck. Then there is this sort of 
storehouse a little further north. I fell there.”
 Dr. Dalyria: “You fell. You have to pay attention to where you walk. So, what
 kinds of things are there? Is it abandoned, too?”
Petras: “I know. I was just distracted. And, I think so. It looked dusty and old.
 But, I think it has traps. So, if we go and check it, I’d like for River to check 
it first. Rangers know about traps and stuff.”
 Dr. Dalyria: “I agree. It would be safe. And who knows, perhaps we find 
useful things for us. By the way, are the things in your list what you needed? 
River said to let her know if we needed anything else.”
 Petras: “I think so, yeah. Let me see.”
 He began patting his chest trying ot find his list. 
Petras: “Oh, would you look at that! I didn’t lose it! Wrong pocket.”
 Dr. Dalyria: “You just got it and you lost it! Petras! That’s a gift.”
 Petras: “I know that now. I told her after she pulled me out of the shooting 
beams.”
 Dr. Dalyria: “What?! Just what did you do on your own?”
 Petras: “So, I fell, right. Then I got up and I thought I lost the rock. So, I 
pulled up some floor boards trying to find it. I stayed there a while trying to 
find it, but I couldn’t. Now, I know why. Anyway, I got annoyed and left. I 
kept going forward and I found a minotaur. So, I thought it a good idea to 
have a bit of fun. You know to relax because I lost the rock.”
 Dr. Dalyria just gave him a worried look. She knew where this was going. 
Petras: “So, I played with it for a bit. And then I bit him. When I was done 
with it, two other ones came out. Larger ones. I was very full, so I took off 
running. But I forgot about the statues.”
 Dr. Dalyria: “Oh no, Petras!”
 Petras: “So, I ran straight into the range of the statues. And they powered up. 
By the time I saw them, I couldn’t stop. I panicked and just kept moving 
forward. I saw River at the top of the tower.
 Dr. Dalyria: “Oh, I forgot she said she was going to look for you. She 
must’ve changed her mind.”
 Petras: “I suppose because she was here. So, the statues shot, but not at me. 
Well, I was in the way. The beam passed through me. It felt like hot but not 
burning. Then it hit the minotaur behind me. By the time they were powering 
up again, River pulled me in to her and we both fell on the steps.”
Dr. Dalyria: “So, it didn’t hurt you? That is intersting.”
 Petras: “Tell me about it. I though we needed the rock to stay safe, but no. 
River told me that the rock is just a rock. That as long as we follow the rule 
to do good onto others, the blessing stays, but if we supot chaos, then the 
blessing is gone and the beams will kill us. It’s a scary thought.”
 Dr. Dalyria: “Oh, this makes sense. There is a lot to learn about this place, 
about them two as well. But, I’m glad we found them. I get the feeling that 
River will try her best to help me with a hospital or even a research center.”
 Petras: “Yeah, Astarion too. She’s got him wrapped around her finger. And 
good. He needs someone to keep him in check.”
 Dr. Dalyria: “You know what? I agree. She is helping him be a good man. 
He’s not the arrogant mini Cazador we knew. And I like that.”
 Petras: “I hope he never finds out we call him that. Hahaha”
 Dr. Dalyria: “I hope so, too. And you know what? Who knows if the 
blessings go so far as to make the impossible possible. I’d love to see it.”
 Petras: “See what? What are you on about?”
 Dr. Dalryria: “Well, we were talking earlier when you both were gone and he 
told me some things that made me wonder. Back at the palace, I found some 
books talking about unions with vampires and women. it seems like there is a
 possibility that vampires can breed live children.”
 Petras: “WHAT?! THAT’S POSSIBLE? BUT HOW?”
 Dr. Dalryria: “Well, that’s what he asked me to help find out. But, it would be
 a medical miracle to have it happen.”
 Petras: “Well, that’s really insane, but to see Astarion running around tryting 
to care for a little tyke sounds pretty hilarious.”
 They stayed there catching up on the days events as they waited for the other 
two to finish their clapping session. They had to wait a while. Then they 
finally heard nothing. They stood up and walked back. 
Once in their rooms, each one decided to call it a day, too.
